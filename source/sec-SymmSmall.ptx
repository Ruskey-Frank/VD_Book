<title>Symmetric Diagrams for Small <m>n</m></title>

<introduction>
<p>
On this page we show many examples of symmetric Venn diagrams for specific values of <I>n</I>.
For <m>n = 2</m>, there is only one Venn diagram and it can be drawn
  to be polar symmetric.
For <m>n = 3</m>, there are two symmetric diagrams.
The classic three circle diagram is monotone, simple, and has
  polar symmetry.
Diagram #3.1 (shown in <xref ref="img-Class1"/>)
  is also a monotone polar symmetric diagram, but it is not simple, nor is it rigid.

<title>Symmetric diagrams with <m>n = 5</m> curves</title>

<p>
The simple ellipse diagram shown to the left is from 
<xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref>, and has a 5-fold rotational symmetry.
It is the only simple symmetric Venn diagram for <I>n</I>=5; in the list below, there are several 
different renderings of it:

Rick Mabry observes that the link of five knots formed by
  weaving the Venn diagram shown above is a Brunnian link ---
  the removal of any knot causes the link to fall apart.
Mabry has created a beautiful rendering of the link made from 
  "ice cream cone curves",
  see <xref ref="img-MabryIce"/>.

A version created by the author is 
  can be see in <xref ref="img-GrunEllipseKnot"/>;
this diagram serves as an illustration of a symmetric 
  Brunnian link<fn>A <term>link</term> is a finite collection of 
  non-intersecting knots (where a knot is a closed, non-self-intersecting curve that is embedded in three dimensions;
  the trivial knot is a simple loop).
  A <term>Brunnian link</term> is a link which is non-trivial, 
  yet every proper sub-collection is trivial.
  A <term>trivial link</term> is one that can be projected to a collection of
  non-intersecting circles in the plane.</fn>
  of order 5. 
  (The usual depiction of the Borromean rings (see <xref ref="sec-Borromean"/>)
  is a symmetric Brunnian link of order 3.)
This Brunnian link is attributed to C. van de Walle by Stewart
  <xref ref="ref-St">[St, pg. 106]</xref>.

  A rendering of the diagram using 5 equilateral triangles
  is given by Grünbaum in <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref> and 
  redrawn here: <xref ref="img-5-VD-triangles"/>.

  Stuart Anderson provided us with the labelled Tutte
  embedding of the diagram; one curve is highlighted, see <xref ref="img-venn5-tutte"/>.

<p>
There are many non-simple symmetric diagrams for
  <m>n=5</m>.  
The one shown <A HREF="gifs/howcirc.gif">here</A> is a play
  on the result that Venn diagrams cannot be constructed from
  "curves that are" circles for <m>n &gt; 3</m>; a statement
  that is no longer true if the three words in quotation marks 
  are removed.

<p>
We have done an exhaustive computer search of all symmetric Venn
  diagrams for <m>n=5</m> (first reported in the 1997 version of this survey).
The number of symmetric Venn diagrams for <m>n=5</m> is 243,
  and the table below shows the number possessing particular
  attributes.
It is a often a trivial matter to construct non-simple diagrams from
  simple ones by "pinching together" simple intersections,
  but this operation does not produce an essentially different
  diagram.
Thus we are particularly interested in rigid diagrams,
  of which there are <m>12+13+2+4 = 31</m>.

For <m>n=5</m>, a symmetric minimum Venn diagram must have at
  least 10 vertices.
There are exactly six symmetric rigid 5-Venn diagrams with 10
  vertices.
One of them is shown below. 
Three others may be seen in 
  <xref ref="img-minsymm5a"/>,
  <xref ref="img-minsymm5b"/>, and
  <xref ref="img-minsymm5c"/>.

<title>Symmetric diagrams with <m>n = 7</m> curves</title>

<sidebyside widths="30% 60%">
<image source="gifs/VicRed10quarter.gif"></image>
<p>
Referring to the case <m>n=7</m>, Grünbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75,p.19]</xref> wrote:
  "at present it seems likely that no such diagram exists."
However, Grünbaum himself later found examples of such diagrams 
  <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref> and
  in 1992 additional examples were also discovered by Anthony 
  Edwards and independently by Carla Savage and Peter Winkler.
One of Grünbaum's examples is a remarkable 
  non-monotone simple symmetric Venn diagram (see
  <xref ref="img-GrunSymm7"/> and <xref ref="img-GrunSymm7color"/>).
<!-- There are <A HREF="nonsymm7.html">23 simple monotone symmetric Venn 
  diagrams</A> for <m>n=7</m>.
-->
Below we summarize what is know about symmetric 7-Venn diagrams.
</p>
</sidebyside>

<subsubsection>
<title>The Grünbaum encoding</title>

<p>
The Grünbaum encoding of a simple symmetric Venn diagram consists of four
  <m>n</m>-ary strings, call them <m>\mathbf{w}</m>, <m>\mathbf{x}</m>,
  <m>\mathbf{y}</m>, <m>\mathbf{z}</m>, each of length 
  <m>(2^{n+1}-4)/n</m>.   
String <m>\mathbf{w}</m> is obtained by first numbering the curves clockwise as
  they appear on the outer face, and then following curve <m>n</m>,
  recording its intersections with each of the other curves.
The other strings are obtained by going counter-clockwise and/or  
  starting with one of the innermost curves; in each case the curves
  must be re-numbered first.
For the 3 circle diagram <m>\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{z} = 1212</m>.
For the 5 ellipse diagram at the top of this page, the strings of the 
  Grünbaum encoding are
</p>

<md>
  <mrow>
  \amp w = z = 142413141324 \text{ and }
  </mrow>
  <mrow>
  \amp x = y = 132414241314.
  </mrow>
</md>

<p>
Of course, we really only need two of the strings, one starting at the
  inside and one at the outside, since <m>\mathbf{w}</m> can be inferred from
  <m>\mathbf{x}</m>, and <m>\mathbf{y}</m> from <m>\mathbf{z}</m> -- but it's convenient to have
  all four, particularly when checking a diagram by hand.
How can <m>\mathbf{x}</m> be obtained from <m>\mathbf{w}</m> in general?
Think of the strings as being indexed <m>i = 1,2,\ldots,M</m>.
The rule is <m>\mathbf{x}[i] = n-\mathbf{w}[M-i+1]</m>.
</p>

<p>
In fact, only one string is required, since string <m>\mathbf{y}</m> is a circular
  rotation of <m>\mathbf{x}</m>. 
The starting position of <m>\mathbf{y}</m> can be determined as the unique position
  in <m>\mathbf{x}</m> where all curves have been encountered an odd number of times 
  (thus implying that we're on the inside of all curves).
In the 5 ellipse example, the starting position of <m>\mathbf{y}</m> is the rightmost
  1 in <m>\mathbf{x}</m>. 
If a single string is chosen to be the representative, then we take the
  lexicographically least of all four.
</p>

<p>
This encoding scheme has its parallels in other disciplines: topologists may 
  recognise the Grünbaum encoding as being closely
  related to the <term>Gauss code</term> of a knot<sup><a href="VennFootEJC.html#gauss_code">10</a></sup>.
</p>

<!-- <P>
A closely related encoding is the <I>G-encoding</I> which is obtained
  by following a curve from the interior/exterior face, numbering and
  recording the curves in the order that they are encountered.
Each string of the encoding is a restricted
  growth string [<A HREF="VennRefs.html#COS">COS</A>],
  meaning that each number is at most one greater than
  the values that precede it, with the first value being 0 (except that
  we take the first value to be 1).
The four strings corresponding to the 5 ellipse example are:
<blockquote>
  <B>w</B> = <B>z</B> = 123214121432 and <BR>
  <B>x</B> = <B>y</B> = 123414341214.
</blockquote> -->

<p>
Tao Cao proved in <xref ref="ref-Ca">[Ca]</xref> that for simple 
  symmetric monotone Venn diagrams, the Grünbaum encoding uniquely identifies the
  diagram (up to isomorphism of plane graphs).

<title>Simple Symmetric 7-Venn Diagrams</title>

<p>
For <m>n=7</m>, all simple monotone symmetric Venn diagrams with polar symmetry 
  are known; there are six of them, and they are listed below.
The first five were discovered by Anthony Edwards using a program to generate
  candidate diagrams and manual checking to eliminate those candidates that
  were not Venn diagrams <xref ref="ref-Ed96">[Ed96]</xref>; however 
  one, Hamilton, was first found constructed by hand by Edwards.  
He named them after the cities in which they were discovered and we
  follow his naming convention (but also number them P1-P6).
Grünbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref> also discovered "Adelaide".
An exhaustive computer search by Frank Ruskey uncovered another, 
  "Victoria", that had been overlooked in Edwards' manual checking.
