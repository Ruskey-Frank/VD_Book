<title>Symmetric Diagrams for Small <m>n</m></title>

<introduction>
<p>
On this page we show many examples of symmetric Venn diagrams for specific values of <I>n</I>.
For <I>n</I> = 2, there is only one Venn diagram and it can be drawn
  to be polar symmetric.
For <I>n</I> = 3, there are two symmetric diagrams.
The classic three circle diagram is monotone, simple, and has
  polar symmetry.
Diagram #3.1 (shown in <xref ref="img-Class1"/>)
  is also a monotone polar symmetric diagram, but it is not simple, nor is it rigid.

The simple ellipse diagram shown to the left is from 
<xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref>, and has a 5-fold rotational symmetry.
It is the only simple symmetric Venn diagram for <I>n</I>=5; in the list below, there are several 
different renderings of it:

Rick Mabry observes that the link of five knots formed by
  weaving the Venn diagram shown above is a Brunnian link ---
  the removal of any knot causes the link to fall apart.
Mabry has created a beautiful rendering of the link made from 
  "ice cream cone curves",
  see <xref ref="img-MabryIce"/>.

A version created by the author is 
  can be see in <xref ref="img-GrunEllipseKnot"/>;
this diagram serves as an illustration of a symmetric 
  Brunnian link<sup><A HREF="VennFootEJC.html#brunnian">7</A></sup> 
  of order 5. 
  (The usual depiction of the Borromean rings (see <xref ref="sec-Borromean"/>)
  is a symmetric Brunnian link of order 3.)
This Brunnian link is attributed to C. van de Walle by Stewart
  <xref ref="ref-St">[St, pg. 106]</xref>.

  A rendering of the diagram using 5 equilateral triangles
  is given by Gr端nbaum in <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref> and 
  redrawn here: <xref ref="img-5-VD-triangles"/>.

  Stuart Anderson provided us with the labelled Tutte
  embedding of the diagram; one curve is highlighted, see <xref ref="img-venn5-tutte"/>.

There are many non-simple symmetric diagrams for
  <m>n=5</m>.  
The one shown <A HREF="gifs/howcirc.gif">here</A> is a play
  on the result that Venn diagrams cannot be constructed from
  "curves that are" circles for <m>n &gt; 3</m>; a statement
  that is no longer true if the three words in quotation marks 
  are removed.

<p>
We have done an exhaustive computer search of all symmetric Venn
  diagrams for <m>n=5</m> (first reported in the 1997 version of this survey).
The number of symmetric Venn diagrams for <m>n=5</m> is 243,
  and the table below shows the number possessing particular
  attributes.
It is a often a trivial matter to construct non-simple diagrams from
  simple ones by "pinching together" simple intersections,
  but this operation does not produce an essentially different
  diagram.
Thus we are particularly interested in rigid diagrams,
  of which there are <m>12+13+2+4 = 31</m>.

For <m>n=5</m>, a symmetric minimum Venn diagram must have at
  least 10 vertices.
There are exactly six symmetric rigid 5-Venn diagrams with 10
  vertices.
One of them is shown below. 
Three others may be seen in 
  <xref ref="img-minsymm5a"/>,
  <xref ref="img-minsymm5b"/>, and
  <xref ref="img-minsymm5c"/>.

Referring to the case <m>n=7</m>, Gr端nbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75,p.19]</xref> wrote:
  "at present it seems likely that no such diagram exists."
However, Gr端nbaum himself later found examples of such diagrams 
  <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref> and
  in 1992 additional examples were also discovered by Anthony 
  Edwards and independently by Carla Savage and Peter Winkler.
One of Gr端nbaum's examples is a remarkable 
  non-monotone simple symmetric Venn diagram (see
  <xref ref="img-GrunSymm7"/> and <xref ref="img-GrunSymm7color"/>).
<!-- There are <A HREF="nonsymm7.html">23 simple monotone symmetric Venn
