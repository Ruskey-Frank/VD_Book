  <title>Generalizations and Extensions of Venn Diagrams</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
    We began <xref ref="sec-defs"/>, "Definition of Venn Diagrams", with a generalization, namely, the independent family, 
    and there are several other variants that have appeared in the literature. Perhaps the most important generalization, 
    Euler diagrams, we treat in <xref ref="sec-Euler"/> below.

<title><m>m</m>-fold Venn diagrams</title>

<p>
In an ordinary Venn diagram each intersection of interiors and exteriors consists of one connected region. Fisher, Koh, and Grünbaum 
  <xref ref="ref-FGK">[FGK]</xref> define a <m>m</m>-fold Venn diagram to be one in which each non-empty intersection consists of exactly <m>m</m> connected regions. 
  They show how to construct such diagrams for any <m>n,m \gt 1</m>.  We show a couple of their examples below.

ARE THESE EXAMPLES ALL DUE TO GRUNBAUM?

<title><m>d</m>-dimensional Venn Diagrams</title>

<p>
Independent sets and Venn diagrams can be generalized to more 
  than two dimensions.
In the definition of independent set and Venn diagram, "curve" gets replaced
  with "boundary of an open <m>d</m>-cell" (that is, homeomorphic
  to a <m>d</m>-sphere) and "region" is replace with "open <m>d</m>-cell".
Rényi, Rényi, and Surányi <xref ref="ref-RRS">[RRS]</xref> proved that an independent family of
  <m>d</m>-spheres has at most <m>d+1</m> members, thereby generalizing
  the result that a Venn diagram whose curves are circles contains
  at most three curves.
</p>

<p>
Grünbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref> mentions several 
  general geometric problems regarding <m>d</m>-dimensional diagrams where the
  sets are required to be boundaries of <m>d</m>-polytopes or
  convex regions.

<title>Infinitely intersecting Venn diagrams</title>

<p>
If we relax the restriction that Venn diagrams meet in only finitely 
  many points, then we lose some of the nice graph theoretic 
  considerations (e.g., the dual graph is no longer a subgraph of the
  hypercube), but do gain some flexibility.
Below we show a diagram made from three congruent curves, red, blue, and green.
Each curve is congruent and they are successively rotated by 
  <m>\pi/4</m> radians about the central point.
</p>

<image source="pdfs/shor.svg" width="60%" />

<p>
Such a construction is possible for any <m>n</m>, and is attributed to Peter
  Shor in Knuth, Graham, and Patashnik <xref ref="ref-GKP">[GKP,p.20,633]</xref>.
  
An order-<m>n</m> (binary) <term>de Bruijn cycle</term><idx>de Bruijn cycle</idx> is a circular binary string of length
  <m>2^n</m> with the property that all <m>2^n</m> substrings of length <m>n</m>
  are distinct, and hence occur exactly once.  For example, <m>0011</m> is a de Bruijn
  cycle for <m>n=2</m>.
A wealth of information about de Bruijn cycles can be found in 
  <xref ref="ref-Kn4">[Kn4]</xref>.
  
The idea of Shor's construction is to take a De Bruijn 
  cycle <m>C</m> of length <m>2^n</m>, together with a regular 
  <m>2^n</m>-gon inscribed in a circle.
Make a curve by successively choosing a circular arc for each 1 
  in <m>C</m> and a polygonal edge segment for each 0.
To obtain the other curves rotate this one about the central point by
  <m>2 k \pi / 2^n</m> radians for 
  <m>k = 1,2,\ldots,n-1</m>.
The example shown above is created by starting with the De Bruijn cycle
<m>C = 00011101</m>.
</p>

<p>
We have already seen some other infinitely intersecting diagrams; the Venn polyominoes
found in <xref ref="sec-MinArea"/>, minimum area diagrams,
which also have infinitely intersecting segments of curves.

<section>
<title>Generalizations of Symmetric diagrams</title>

<p>
On the page <a href="VennSymmVariants.html#nonprime">Variants on Symmetry</a> we have already discussed
a generalization of symmetric Venn diagrams, namely pseudo-symmetric diagrams (which retain
the property of being a Venn diagram while relaxing the notion of symmetry).  Here we take
the opposite tack by retaining the strict definition of symmetry but extending it to 
non-Venn diagrams.  Our motivation is the fact that if <m>n</m> is not prime, symmetric
Venn diagrams cannot exist.  
</p>

<p>
It is natural to consider diagrams that are "close" to Venn
diagrams, in that the number of regions is as close to <m>2^n</m> as possible
while still being symmetric.  We have already seen on the "What is Venn Diagram?" page 
that Venn diagrams are 
instances of independent families, and in <xref ref="ref-Gr99">[Gr99]</xref>, 
Grünbaum 
generalized the concept of symmetry in Venn diagrams
to independent families.
</p>

<idx>equilateral triangles</idx>

<image source="pngs/4-ISF-grunbaum.png"/>
</figure>

<p>
If <m>n</m> is not prime, there will be 
some <m>i</m> such that regions enclosed by <m>i</m> curves must be 
repeated to create a symmetric diagram, and
thus we must have more than <m>2^n</m> regions in any symmetric diagram.
Grünbaum gave the lower bound <m>I(n)</m> on the number of
required regions: 
<me>
I(n) = 2 + n (N_n - 2 ), 
</me>
where <m>N_n</m> is the
number of binary necklaces of length <m>n</m>.<idx>necklace</idx>
The numbers <m>N_n</m> are well-studied, see 
<xref ref="ref-GKP">[GKP, pp. 139-141]</xref>
for explicit formulae and further references; also see <xref ref="sec-necklace"/>, 
Symmetric Diagrams, Necklaces, and Chains, for some important 
connections between necklaces and constructing symmetric Venn diagrams. 
The table below
gives <m>I(n)</m> for small non-prime values of <m>n</m>.
</p>

<p>
<xref ref="fig-4ind"/>, from <xref ref="ref-Gr99">[Gr99]</xref>, shows a symmetric independent family of
four equilateral triangles with <m>I(4) = 18</m> regions.
</p>

<p>
In the same paper Grünbaum conjectured that
symmetric independent families with only <m>I(n)</m>
regions exist for every integer <m>n</m> (this includes the special case 
that <m>n</m> is prime, and the symmetric
independent family is just a symmetric Venn diagram --- it has no repeated regions).
</p>

<p>
We can also create a symmetric diagram
by removing as few regions as possible from a Venn diagram to create an
Euler diagram that is not an independent family (as some regions will be missing)
but will retain rotational symmetry - we can call these
<term>near-Venn</term> diagrams.<idx>Euler diagram</idx><idx>near-Venn diagram</idx>
Symmetric near-Venn diagrams for non-prime <m>n</m>
are maximally symmetric Euler diagrams in the sense that they
cannot have any more regions added without either
losing their symmetry or repeating regions.  The numbers <m>E(n)</m> in the table
below are known upper bounds on the number of regions in a symmetric near-Venn diagram 
(they are not difficult to calculate; see <xref ref="ref-RW04">[RW04]</xref> for a formula).

<p>
As we can see, the numbers <m>I(n)</m> and <m>E(n)</m> fairly closely bracket <m>2^n</m>.
In <xref ref="ref-Ji">[Ji]</xref>, Zongliang Jiang extended the construction algorithm of [<a href="VennRefs.html#GKS">GKS</a>] for
prime <m>n</m> to composite <m>n \le 16</m>; this construction repeats the minimum number of regions
possible to create symmetric independent families with <m>I(n)</m> regions.
</p>

<figure width="70%">
<caption>A symmetric independent family of 6 curves.  The repeated regions are labelled, 
for example the region enclosed by the black, red and green curves is
	labelled by a "4" and occurs three times.

</figure>

<p>
In addition to examples for small <m>n</m> in <xref ref="ref-Gr99">[Gr99]</xref>, 
many examples of larger symmetric independent families and near-Venn diagrams 
can be found in <xref ref="ref-RW04">[RW04]</xref>, <xref ref="ref-Wes">[Wes]</xref>, and <xref ref="ref-Ji">[Ji]</xref>.  
The above examples are from <xref ref="ref-Wes">[Wes]</xref>.  

Grünbaum also noticed, as have we, that, aside from the case <m>E(4) = 14</m>, for which a simple diagram can 
be easily constructed, there do not seem to be any <em>simple</em> symmetric independent families or near-Venn diagrams attaining the given
bounds.  Why this should be is entirely unknown!
