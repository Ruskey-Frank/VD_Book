<title>How many are there?</title>

<p>
The precise number of Venn diagrams and Venn classes has been determined
  by Chilakamarri, Hamburger and Pippert
  <xref ref="ref-CHP96b">[CHP96b]</xref>,
  <xref ref="ref-HP97">[HP97]</xref>,
  <xref ref="ref-CHP00">[CHP00]</xref>
  for <m>n = 1,2,3</m>,
  and for simple diagrams and classes if <m>n = 4,5</m>.
Clearly, for <m>n = 1,2</m> there is only one diagram but, perhaps surprisingly, things get
  interesting for <m>n = 3</m>.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Diagrams with <m>n = 3</m> curves</title>

<p>
For <m>n = 3</m> there are six distinct Venn classes and fourteen distinct
  Venn diagrams.  Only one of the diagrams is simple (Class 6).
We denote the diagrams as #3.1, #3.2, ..., #3.14 in order to refer to them later.
Each class has two corresponding Figures

<ul>
<li>
  Class 1 (#3.1,#3.2): <xref ref="img-Class1"/>, <xref ref="img-CO-Class1"/>.
</li>
<li>
  Class 2 (#3.3,#3.4): <xref ref="img-Class2"/>, <xref ref="img-CO-Class2"/>.
</li>
<li>
  Class 3 (#3.5,#3.6): <xref ref="img-Class3"/>, <xref ref="img-CO-Class3"/>.
</li>
<li>
  Class 4 (#3.7,#3.8,#3.9,#3.10): <xref ref="img-Class4"/>, <xref ref="img-CO-Class4"/>.
</li>
<li>
  Class 5 (#3.11,#3.12,#3.13): <xref ref="img-Class5"/>, <xref ref="img-CO-Class5"/>.
</li>
<li>
  Class 6 (#3.14): <xref ref="fig-V3"/>, <xref ref="fig-CO-V3"/>.
</li>

<LI><A HREF="VennWhatEJC.html#3circle">Class 6</A> (diagram #3.14
  the three circle diagram shown on the "what is a Venn diagram?" page);
  with <A HREF="VennWhatEJC.html#3circle">regions colored</A>.
-->
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Note that classes 2 and 3 are equivalent but not isomorphic, as are
  diagrams #3.3 &amp; #3.6 (and #3.4 &amp; #3.5).
Diagram #3.3 appears also in
  <xref ref="ref-ES">[ES]</xref> (showing that it is a convex ADD LINK diagram).
The diagrams in Class 2 have the property that each pair of curves at
  a point of intersection meet transversally;
  the diagrams of Class 3 do not have this property.
Aside from the simple diagram of Class 6, only Class 2 is rigid; the
  other classes are non-rigid.

<title>Diagrams with <m>n = 4</m> curves</title>

<p>
For <m>n = 4</m> there are two distinct simple Venn diagrams
  and one distinct simple Venn class (this was first observed by
  Grünbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr92a">[Gr92a,p.8]</xref>
  and proven in <xref ref="ref-CHP96b">[CHP96b]</xref>).
Drawings of these two are shown in Figures 4 (a) and (b) in
  <xref ref="ref-Gr92a">[Gr92a,p.7]</xref>, and are redrawn here:

<subsection>
<title>Diagrams with <m>n = 5</m> curves</title>

<p>
For <m>n = 5</m>, there are 11 distinct, reducible,
  simple Venn classes and 12 distinct, reducible, simple
  Venn diagrams.
Drawings of these may be found in
  <xref ref="ref-HP97">[HP97]</xref>.
There are 8 distinct simple, irreducible Venn classes
  (<xref ref="ref-CHP00">[CHP00]</xref>).
Five of them have one convex drawing in the plane
  (and four of these were discovered by Grünbaum).
All five can be drawn with five congruent ellipses.
Thus, in total, there are 19 simple Venn classes
  for <m>n = 5</m>.
</p>

<p>
In proving these results several theorems of independent interest were proven:
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
A simple Venn diagram for <m>n &gt; 2</m> is 3-connected.
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
A theorem of Whitney <xref ref="ref-Wh">[Wh]</xref> states that
  a plane embedding of a 3-connected planar graph is unique, once the
  outer face has been identified.
Thus, to determine whether two Venn diagrams are in the same class, we need
  only try all possible embeddings of one of them with each of its faces
  as the outer region and observe whether any of these embeddings is
  isomorphic to the other diagram.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
A simple Venn dual for <m>n &gt; 2</m> is 3-connected.
</statement>
</theorem>

<theorem>
<statement>
No two edges in a face in a Venn diagram belong to the same curve.
</statement>
</theorem>

<subsection>
<title>Diagrams with <m>n = 6</m> curves</title>

<p>
The total number of Venn diagrams for <m>n = 6</m> is not known.
As part of his search for 6-Venn triangles, Carroll
  <xref ref="ref-Ca99">[Ca99]</xref> reports that
  there are 1833 non-isomorphic simple monotone 6-Venn diagrams with the
  additional property that there are no more than 6 crossings
  between any pair of curves.
