<title>Open Problems about Venn Diagrams</title>

<title>Combinatorial and existential problems</title>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
There are 11 3-Venn diagrams and 6 3-Venn classes.  How many 4-Venn diagrams and 4-Venn classes are there?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Find a simple symmetric 17-Venn diagram.  More generally, prove that <em>simple</em> symmetric <m>n</m>-Venn diagrams
  exist for all prime <m>n</m>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Verify that there are 33 simple symmetric non-monotone 7-Venn diagrams.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Prove Winkler's conjecture that every <em>simple</em> <m>n</m>-Venn diagram is extendible to at simple <m>(n+1)</m>-Venn diagram.
Equivalently: Is every planar dual graph of a simple Venn diagram Hamiltonian?
Or find a counter example.  The conjecture is know to be true for all <m>n \le 5</m>.
</p>
</li>

<!-- -->
<p>
It has been conjectured that all non-simple Venn diagrams are Hamiltonian.  Prove or find a counter-example.  It is known that all
simple Venn diagrams are Hamiltonian; see 
<xref ref="ref-PR">[PR]</xref>.
</p>
<!-- -->

<li>
<p>
The dual of a simple Venn diagram is a maximal planar spanning
  subgraph of the hypercube. 
Does every maximal spanning subgraph of the hypercube occur as the
  Venn graph of some Venn diagram?
It seems likely that the answer is no.
Note that the hypercube <m>Q_n</m> is planar for <m>1 \le n \le 3</m>, so a
  counter-example must have <m>n \ge 4</m>.
COUNTER EXAMPLE PROVIDED ALREADY?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Determine the exact number of simple symmetric non-monotone 7-Venn diagrams.  It is suspected that the number is 33, but the problem is to 
  provide a proof, either by exhaustive computer search or by mathematical arguments; see <xref ref="sec-nonmono7"/>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Find a minimum vertex <m>n</m>-Venn diagram for <m>n=8</m>; such a diagram would have 37 vertices.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What is the least number of intersection points (vertices) in a <em>rigid</em> Venn diagram?  There is only one rigid <m>3</m>-Venn diagram,
the classic simple 3 circle diagram.
</p>
</li>

<title>Geometric problems</title>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
For every <m>n</m>, is there a convex Venn diagram made from congruent
  curves?
If we drop the condition of curves being finitely intersecting, then the answer is yes; see <xref ref="sec-inf"/>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There is a rotationally symmetric simple 7-Venn diagram constructed with congruent convex quadrilaterals, as shown in <xref ref="fig-7quad"/>.
It is equivalent to the diagram "Victoria".  Can any of the other 23 symmetric simple 7-Venn diagram be constructed with congruent convex 
  quadrilaterals?  
If not, what about congruent <em>non-convex</em> quadrilaterals?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Over all <m>n</m>-Venn diagrams, which requires the greatest number of
  straight line segments to draw it?  ELABORATE.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<title>polyVenn diagrams</title>

<p>
See <xref ref="sec-MinArea"/> for background material on polyVenn diagrams.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
<idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>minimum area</h></idx><idx>congruent</idx>
Find a minimum area <m>n</m>-polyVenn diagram made from <m>n</m> congruent polyominoes for <m>n = 6</m>.  For <m>n = 5</m>, 
  find a polyVenn diagram made from congruent polyominoes but without allowing reflection.  Or prove that no such
diagrams exists.  It seems likely that there is some large enough <m>n</m> for which congruent polyomino minimum area Venn diagrams
cease to exist.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<idx>Mersenne prime</idx>
Find examples of <m>n</m>-polyVenn diagrams with no cell representing the empty set, and existing in a rectangular <m>h \times w</m> grid.  
Thus <m>2^n -1 = h \cdot w</m> and <m>h,w \ge 3</m>, so <m>2^n-1</m> can't be a Mersenne prime.  
These diagrams are known to exist for <m>(2^{n/2}+1) \cdot (2^{n/2}-1)</m> if <m>n \ge 2</m>, but not otherwise.
The first few open cases are
<me>
63 = 3 \times 21\text{, }
255 = 3 \times 85 = 5 \times 51 \text{, and }
511 = 7 \times 73.

<p>
For every integer <m>n</m> there exists a symmetric independent family of <m>n</m> curves with only <m>I(n)</m> regions.
See <xref ref="sec-GenSymm"/> for the formula for <m>I(n)</m>.  This conjecture is due to Grünbaum 
<!-- <xref ref="ref-Gr99">[Gr99,pg.6]<xref/>, and -->
is true for prime <m>n</m> by the results of <xref ref="sec-SymmGeneral"/>.
</p>

<p>
If integer <m>n</m> is not a prime, every symmetric independent family with <m>I(n)</m> regions is non-simple.
See <xref ref="sec-GenSymm"/> for the formula for <m>I(n)</m>.  This conjecture is due to Grünbaum 
<xref ref="ref-Gr99">[Gr99,pg.6]</xref>, and
is false for prime <m>n</m> by the results of <xref ref="sec-SymmGeneral"/>.  It is known to be true for <m>n \le 16</m> by the results
of <xref ref="ref-Ji">[Ji]</xref>.
