  <title>Graphs Associated with Venn Diagrams</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>When reasoning about Venn diagrams, it is usually useful to think about their graph theoretic properties.

<section>
<title>The Planar Dual of a Venn Diagram</title>

<p>
An <m>n</m>-Venn diagram <m>\mathbf{C} = \{ C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n \}</m>
  may be regarded as a graph in two ways.
The diagram itself can be thought of as an edge-colored
  plane<fn>A <term>planar graph</term> is one that can be embedded in the plane without crossing edges. 
    A <term>plane graph</term> is a planar graph that has been embedded in the plane.</fn> graph <m>V(\mathbf{C})</m>
    <idx><h>graph</h><h>planar</h></idx><idx><h>graph</h><h>planar</h></idx>
  whose vertices correspond to intersections of curves, and whose
  edges correspond to the segments of curves
  between intersections.
Edges are colored according to the curve to which they belong.
Following Chilakamarri, Hamburger, and Pippert
  <xref ref="ref-CHP95">[CHP95]</xref>,
  we overload the term and call this graph the <term>Venn diagram</term>.
In an <term>unlabelled</term> Venn diagram we ignore the edge labels.
As an example, the three circle Venn diagram
  has 6 vertices (corresponding to the 6 intersections) and 12 edges.
Recall Euler's formula <m>f = e - v + 2</m> relating
  the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a graph
  embedded in the plane.
Assuming that no three curves intersect at a common point
  (i.e., a simple Venn diagram), the graph is 4-regular and so we have <m>e = 2v</m>.
By definition the number of faces is <m>f = 2^n</m>.
It thus follows that <m>v = 2^n - 2</m> and
  <m>e = 2^{n+1} - 4</m> for simple Venn diagrams.
</p>

<p>
Two curves can meet at a point <term>transversally</term> or not, depending
  on whether the two curves cross.<idx>transversal intersection</idx>
A moment's reflection will convince you that the curves in a
  simple Venn diagram must meet transversally.
More generally, at any point of intersection in a Venn diagram,
  there must be at least two curves that meet transversally.
</p>

<p>
<idx>Venn dual</idx>
With each Venn diagram, <m>\mathbf{C}</m>, we may associate another plane graph
  called the <term>Venn dual</term>, which is denoted <m>D(\mathbf{C})</m>,
  the planar dual of the Venn diagram.
  (Warning: Some authors use the term "Venn graph" to refer to the dual.)
Its vertices are the connected open regions (faces) of <m>V(\mathbf{C})</m>.
Two vertices are connected by an edge if they share a common boundary.
By default the edges are colored (by the color of the corresponding
  edge in the Venn diagram).
At times it is also useful to
  label the vertices with a length-<m>n</m> bitstring consisting of 0s and 1s;
  if the curves are labelled 1 to <m>n</m> then we set bit <m>i</m> to
  1 if the vertex is enclosed by curve <m>i</m>, 0 otherwise.    Labels
  of adjacent vertices differ in exactly one bit position as one curve in the Venn diagram
  is crossed by one edge in the Venn dual.
For example, the Venn dual of the three circle Venn
  diagram is a planar embedding of the 3-cube, <m>Q_3</m>.
Clearly, every <m>n</m>-Venn dual is a planar spanning subgraph of the
  <m>n</m>-cube, <m>Q_n</m>.
If <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is a simple Venn diagram, then every face of <m>D(\mathbf{C})</m>
  is a quadrilateral, and thus <m>D(\mathbf{C})</m> is a maximal
  bipartite<fn>A <term>bipartite</term> graph is one in which the vertices can be 
  partitioned into two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> where every edge is incident with a vertex from <m>A</m> and a vertex from <m>B</m>. 
  The <m>n</m>-cube is bipartite, and thus so is the Venn dual.</fn>
  planar graph.

Above we illustrate these definitions.
The following section contains illustrations of some
  Venn duals.

<title>The Venn Duals of Venn's Construction</title>

<p>
Here are the Venn dual graphs of Venn's general construction for
  <m>n=3,4,5</m>, but without coloured edges for the corresponding to the curves.
Here the red edges indicate the Hamilton cycle that is used in extending
  to the next higher value of <m>n</m>.
</p>

<image source="gifs/VennGraphs.gif"></image>

<p>
How, in general, do you go from the dual graph <m>D</m> of
  a Venn diagram, together with a  Hamilton cycle
  <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>, and get a new planar
  dual <m>D'</m> of a Venn diagram of the
  next higher order?
We now explain this process.
Note that <m>H</m> is a simple closed curve with an interior
  and an exterior.
</p>

<image source="gifs/VennExpand.gif"></image>

<p>
We illustrate the discussion with the expansion of <m>n=4</m>
  to <m>n=5</m> as shown above.
Color the edges of <m>H</m> red, edges on the interior blue,
  and edges on the exterior black.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Each (black) vertex of <m>D</m> is split into two vertices, one green
  and one blue, in <m>D'</m>.
The blue vertices are in the interior, the red edges in the exterior.
</li>
<li>Each blue edge in <m>D</m> becomes a blue edge in <m>D'</m>
  connecting the corresponding blue vertices.
</li>
<li>Each black edge in <m>D</m> becomes a black edge in <m>D'</m>
  connecting the corresponding green vertices.
</li>
<li>Each red edge in <m>D</m> becomes a 4-cycle of red edges in
  <m>D'</m>, connecting either corresponding vertices or vertices
  of the same color.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<idx><h>graph</h><h>prism of</h></idx>
Note that the red edges in <m>D'</m> give the prism of the Hamilton
  cycle in <m>D</m>.
