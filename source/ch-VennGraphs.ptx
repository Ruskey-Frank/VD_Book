  <title>Graphs Associated with Venn Diagrams</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>When reasoning about Venn diagrams, it is usually useful to think about their graph theoretic properties.

<title>The Planar Dual of a Venn Diagram</title>

<p>
An <m>n</m>-Venn diagram <m>\mathbf{C} = \{ C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n \}</m>
  may be regarded as a graph in two ways.
The diagram itself can be thought of as an edge-colored
  plane<fn>A <term>planar graph</term> is one that can be embedded in the plane without crossing edges. 
    A <term>plane graph</term> is a planar graph that has been embedded in the plane.</fn> graph <m>V(\mathbf{C})</m>
    <idx><h>graph</h><h>planar</h></idx><idx><h>graph</h><h>planar</h></idx>
  whose vertices correspond to intersections of curves, and whose
  edges correspond to the segments of curves
  between intersections.
Edges are colored according to the curve to which they belong.
Following Chilakamarri, Hamburger, and Pippert
  <xref ref="ref-CHP95">[CHP95]</xref>,
  we overload the term and call this graph the <term>Venn diagram</term>.
In an <term>unlabelled</term> Venn diagram we ignore the edge labels.
There is no loss of information in the unlabelled version of a Venn graph if the corresponding Venn diagram
  is <em>simple</em>, since each of the curves can be uniquely recovered.
We will see examples later where this is not true of non-simple diagrams.
</p>

<p>
Let us count the number of vertices, edges, and faces in an <m>n</m>-Venn diagram.
As an example, the three circle Venn diagram
  has 8 faces (corresponding to the 8 possible interior/exterior possibilities), 
  6 vertices (corresponding to the 6 intersections) and 12 edges.
Recall Euler's formula <m>f = e - v + 2</m> relating
  the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a graph
  embedded in the plane.<idx><h>Euler</h><h>formula</h></idx>
Assuming that no three or more curves intersect at a common point
  (i.e., a simple Venn diagram), the graph is 4-regular and so we have <m>e = 2v</m>.
By definition the number of faces is <m>f = 2^n</m>.
It thus follows that <m>v = 2^n - 2</m> and
  <m>e = 2^{n+1} - 4</m> for simple Venn diagrams.
By <xref ref="obs-maxn"/> the maximum vertex degree is <m>2n</m> 
</p>

<p>
<idx>Venn dual</idx>
<idx><h>graph</h><h>bipartite</h></idx>
<idx><h>graph</h><h>hypercube</h></idx>
With each Venn diagram, <m>\mathbf{C}</m>, we may associate another plane graph
  called the <term>Venn dual</term>, which is denoted <m>D(\mathbf{C})</m>,
  the planar dual of the Venn diagram.
  (Warning: Some authors use the term "Venn graph" to refer to the dual.)
Its vertices are the connected open regions (faces) of <m>V(\mathbf{C})</m>.
Two vertices are connected by an edge if they share a common boundary.
By default the edges are colored (by the color of the corresponding
  edge in the Venn diagram).
At times it is also useful to
  label the vertices with a length-<m>n</m> bitstring consisting of 0s and 1s;
  if the curves are labelled 1 to <m>n</m> then we set bit <m>i</m> to
  1 if the vertex is enclosed by curve <m>i</m>, 0 otherwise.    Labels
  of adjacent vertices differ in exactly one bit position as one curve in the Venn diagram
  is crossed by one edge in the Venn dual.
For example, the Venn dual of the three circle Venn
  diagram is a planar embedding of the 3-cube, <m>Q_3</m>.
Clearly, every <m>n</m>-Venn dual is a planar spanning subgraph of the
  <m>n</m>-cube, <m>Q_n</m>.
If <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is a simple Venn diagram, then every face of <m>D(\mathbf{C})</m>
  is a quadrilateral, and thus <m>D(\mathbf{C})</m> is a maximal
  bipartite<fn>A <term>bipartite</term> graph is one in which the vertices can be 
  partitioned into two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> where every edge is incident with a vertex from <m>A</m> and a vertex from <m>B</m>. 
  The <m>n</m>-cube is bipartite, and thus so is the Venn dual.</fn>
  planar graph.

Above we illustrate these definitions.
The following subsection contains illustrations of some
  Venn duals.

<title>The Venn Duals of Venn's Construction</title>

<p>
Here are the Venn dual graphs of Venn's general construction for
  <m>n=3,4,5</m>, but without coloured edges for the different curves.
Rather, here the red edges indicate the Hamilton cycle that is used in extending
  to the next higher value of <m>n</m>.
</p>

<image source="pdfs/VennDuals345"></image>

<p>
How, in general, do you go from the dual graph <m>D</m> of
  a Venn diagram <m>V</m>, together with a  Hamilton cycle
  <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>, and get a new planar
  dual <m>D'</m> of a Venn diagram <m>V'</m> of the
  next higher order?
We now explain this process.
Note that <m>H</m> is a simple closed curve with an interior
  and an exterior, and that the edges not in <m>H</m> lie either 
  in the interior or in the exterior.
</p>

<image source="pdfs/VennDuals45"></image>

<p>
We illustrate the discussion with the expansion of <m>n=4</m>
  to <m>n=5</m> using the image above.
In the dual <m>D</m> where <m>n=4</m> the edges of <m>H</m> are red, edges on the interior are black,
  and edges on the exterior are gold.  
We now discuss how to obtain the central dual in the image.
This part of the discussion works in general for a simple <m>n</m>-Venn diagram with a Hamilton cycle.
Thus there are <m>2^{n+1}-4</m> edges in <m>D</m>, of which <m>2^n</m> are red, <m>2^{n-1}-2</m> are gold
  and <m>2^{n-1}-2</m> are black.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Each (black) vertex of <m>D</m> is split into two vertices, one green
  and one blue, in <m>D'</m>.
The blue vertices are in the interior, the green vertices in the exterior.  In <m>V</m> this
  corresponds to splitting each region into 2 regions, one interior to <m>H</m> and one exterior to <m>H</m>.
</li>
<li>Each black (interior) edge in <m>D</m> remains a black edge in <m>D'</m>
  connecting the corresponding blue vertices.
</li>
<li>Each gold (exterior) edge in <m>D</m> becomes a gold edge in <m>D'</m>
  connecting the corresponding green vertices.
</li>
<li>
The remaining edges form two cycles, one of green vertices (and edges) and the other of blue vertices (and edges).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the <m>D'</m> is indeed a Venn dual of a Venn diagram <m>V'</m> because all of the original curves are intact; they just enclose
  twice as many faces, half blue and half green.  
The curve defined by the thick black edges is the new curve and it has all the blue faces on it's interior, and all
  the green faces on its exterior.
</p>  
  
<p>
To finish the construction we just need to show that there is a Hamilton cycle <m>H'</m> in <m>D'</m>.
This will be formed by joining the green cycle and the blue cycle, using a <term>flip</term> of edges in a 4-cycle in <m>D'</m>.
Any 4-cycle whose consecutive edges are green, black, blue, black will work; i.e., the flip removes the green and blue edges from
  their cycles and adds the two black edges to the cycle to give a Hamilton cycle.
Such edges abound: any red edge in <m>D</m> becomes such a cycle in <m>D'</m>.
In Venn's construction, the chosen edge of <m>H</m> is the leftmost red edge with orientation <m>\diagdown</m>; the resulting
  4-cycle is shown with dashed lines on the right in the image.
</p>

<p><idx>prism</idx>
Peter Winkler provides a similar discussion in
  <xref ref="ref-Wi">[Wi,pg. 271]</xref>. 
The discussion above essentially proves one direction of <xref ref="thm-A"/> and <xref ref="thm-B"/>. 
Note that the blue, green, and thick black edges of the middle image are the prism of the red Hamilton
  cycle in the left image.
