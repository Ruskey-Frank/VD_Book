  <title>Geometric Variations</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
    There are many geometric aspects of Venn diagrams and generalizations that have
    been considered in the literature.  We have seen some diagrams already
    whose form is motivated by geometric issues; for example, Venn diagrams 
    made from <a href="gifs/V3plain.gif">circles</a>, 
    <a href="gifs/5-VD-ellipses-colour.gif">ellipses</a>, 
    <a href="pngs/5-VD-symm-rectangles.png">rectangles</a>, 
    <a href="gifs/5-VD-triangles.gif">triangles</a>, and <a href="gifs/scan-venn4.gif">a 7-Venn diagram</a> whose curves are non-convex 5-gons.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Several articles discuss the geometric procedures used to draw Venn diagrams.  
    Glassner <xref ref="ref-Gl">[Gl]</xref> discusses some of the computational aspects of generating diagrams using Edwards' construction 
    [<a href="VennRefs.html#Ed89a">Ed89a</a>].  The survey article of Hamburger
    <xref ref="ref-Ha98b">[Ha98b]</xref> contains a wealth of material on geometric aspects of Venn diagrams, particularly
    convexity issues.
    </p>

It is interesting to note that Venn himself, in the final chapter of his book <xref ref="ref-Ve81">[Ve81]</xref>,
speaks in no uncertain terms of his opinions of these geometric considerations:

<blockquote>
<p>
"My own conviction is very decided that all introduction of considerations
such as these should be avoided as tending to confound the domains of
Logic and Mathematics; of that which is, broadly speaking, qualitative,
and that which is quantitative.  The compartments yielded by our diagrams
must be regarded solely in the light of being bounded by such and such
contours, as lying inside or outside such and such lines.  <em>We must
abstract entirely from all consideration of their relative magnitude,
as we do of their actual shape, and trace no more connection between
these facts and the logical extension of the terms which they represent
than we do between this logical extension and the size and shape of the
letter symbols, A and B and C.</em>"  (Quoted in <xref ref="ref-EE">[EE]</xref>.  Our emphasis added.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<section>
<title>Convexity</title>

<p>
A Venn diagram is <term>convex</term> if the interior of each  
  of its curves is convex.
Note that the regions of a Venn diagram can alway be made convex,
  for example, by taking the Tutte embedding<sup><a href="VennFootEJC.html#tutte">11</a></sup> of the diagram.
Grünbaum also defines a stronger notion of convexity by insisting
  that not only are the curves convex, but also regions and the
  complement of the external region; we call this condition
  <term>strong convexity</term>, but it has not been much explored in the literature.
</p>

<p>
Every monotone Venn diagram is isomorphic to a convex diagram
  via the following result of Bultena, Grünbaum, and Ruskey
  <xref ref="ref-BGR">[BGR]</xref>.
  A FISC is a family of <i>F</i>initely <i>I</i>ntersecting <i>S</i>imple closed
<i>C</i>urves in the plane, with the property that the intersection of
  the interiors of all the curves is not empty.
Clearly, every Venn diagram is a FISC.
A FISC is <term>monotone</term> if its directed dual graph has a unique
  source and a unique sink; this corresponds with our definition
  of a monotone Venn diagram.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-monotone">
<statement>
<p>
A FISC has a convex drawing in the plane if and only if it is
monotone.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
It is known (by construction, see, for example, <xref ref="ref-RRS">[RRS]</xref>, 
<xref ref="ref-PS">[PS]</xref>, 
<xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref>, and <xref ref="ref-BR">[BR]</xref>) that there
exists a convex <m>n</m>-Venn diagram for every positive value of <m>n</m>,
and thus by the above result there is a monotone one as well.

<title>Diagrams made from convex <m>k</m>-gons</title>

<p>
Let the term <term><m>k</m>-gon</term> designate any convex polygon with at most <m>k</m>
  sides.  Observe that two <m>k</m>-gons can (finitely) intersect with
  each other in at most <m>2k</m> points; for the purposes of this
  discussion we can treat a circle as a 1-gon and an ellipse as a
  2-gon.  
  We start off with a lemma first observed by Grünbaum
  <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref>, and discuss its consequences.
  RELATE THIS TO EARLIER THEOREM.
 </p>

<theorem>
<statement>
For a simple <m>n</m>-Venn diagram of <m>k</m>-gons to exist,
<m>k \ge \lceil (2^{n-1}-1) / {n \choose 2} \rceil </m>.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
Given a diagram of <m>k</m>-gons, the number of
vertices contributed by any two of them can be at most 2<m>k</m>, so the
number of vertices must be at most <m>2 k {n \choose 2}</m>.  Since
the number of vertices in a simple diagram is <m>2^n - 2</m>, the inequality follows.
</p>
</proof>
</theorem> 

<p>
A slight improvement to this theorem was obtained in <xref ref="ref-CRW">[CRW]</xref>.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-CRW">
<statement>
For a simple <m>n</m>-Venn diagram of <m>k</m>-gons to exist,

<title>Triangles</title>

<p>
Jeremy Carroll, while he was employed at HP Labs (Bristol, England), 
  in <xref ref="ref-Ca00">[Ca00]</xref> solved the problem of finding a collection of six triangles that
  form a Venn diagram.
</p>

<p>
There is a simple symmetric 5-Venn diagram in which
  each curve is a triangle; see <xref ref="img-5-VD-triangles"/>, 
  redrawn from Grünbaum 
  <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref>.
Grünbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr84b">[Gr84b]</xref>
  asked whether there was a 6-Venn diagram made from triangles.
Years later, this question was answered in the affirmative by
  Jeremy Carroll, while he was employed at HP Labs (Bristol, England), in <xref ref="ref-Ca00">[Ca00]</xref>.
His first discovered example is shown below, and like his other diagrams, it is simple.
He subsequently discovered that there are exactly
  126 different 6-Venn diagrams that can be drawn where
  each curve is a triangle.
</p>

<p>
Triangles cannot be used to construct a 7-Venn diagram; the proof for the simple case is quite short.  
A full proof in the non-simple case may be found in <xref ref="ref-CRW">[CRW]</xref>.
Although it follows from <xref ref="thm-CRW"/>, we provide below a proof that there
is no simple 7-Venn diagram whose curves are triangles.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
A simple Venn diagram of 7 triangles is impossible.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
Assume such a diagram exists.  By counting
the number of vertices, as in Lemma G above, we see that 
<m>6{7 \choose 2} = 2^7 - 2</m>; 
thus, every pair of triangles must intersect in six points. 
Thus for any corner <m>A</m> of any triangle <m>t</m>, and any other triangle <m>t'</m>, 
the point <m>A</m> lies outside <m>t'</m>. Thus <m>A</m> lies on the outer face of the diagram, and
the other face at <m>A</m> is the one inside <m>t</m> alone. Since the same 
argument holds for a second corner <m>B</m> of <m>t</m>, we have that the non-outer face at <m>A</m>
is also the non-outer face at <m>B</m>, but an edge of <m>t'</m> separates them.  Thus we have
a disconnected region, which contradicts the fact that the diagram is a Venn diagram. 
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>

</subsection>

<subsection>
<title><m>k</m>-gons for <m>k > 3</m></title>

<p>
We note that many constructions for Venn diagrams produce diagrams of <m>k</m>-gons where 
the value <m>k</m> is a function of <m>n</m> (for examples, see <xref ref="ref-PS">[PS]</xref>
or <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref>).
By the results of <xref ref="ref-PS">[BGR]</xref> any convex <m>n</m>-FISC (and consequently any monotone <m>n</m>-Venn diagram) with
  <m>N</m> points of intersection is drawable with <m>N</m>-gons.
  <idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>monotone</h></idx>
As a consequence any monotone <m>n</m>-Venn diagram can be drawn with <m>(2^n-2)</m>-gons.
Grünbaum's convex construction 
  <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref> 
is very much like Edwards' general
  construction, except that the initial circle is replaced by a square and the
  <m>n</m>th curve is a <m>2^{n-2}</m>-gon; this gives the upper bounds
  in the table above.
Also, Grünbaum 
  <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75, pg.17]</xref> 
  states that "the construction we
  used ... is a modification to convex polygons of the method
  described in More <xref ref="ref-Mo">[Mo]</xref>." 
</p>

<p>
In <xref ref="ref-CRW">[CRW]</xref> Carroll, Ruskey, and Weston proved that there is a
symmetric 7-Venn diagram drawn with 4-gons, which meets the lower bound of <xref ref="thm-CRW"/>.
See <xref ref="fig-7quad"/>.  The coordinates of one of the quadrilaterals is given in the
list below.  The other 6 quadrilaterals may be obtained from this one by rotating about the origin.
The diagram is isomorphic to "Victoria".

<title>Exposure</title>

<p>
DOES THIS SECTION BELONG ELSEWHERE?
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-exposed">
<idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>exposed</h></idx>
<statement>
A Venn diagram is <term>exposed</term> if each of its curves touches the
  outer face at some point of non-intersection.
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
Note, for example, that the 3-Venn diagram #3.2 of <xref ref="img-Class1"/> is not exposed, even
  though all curves have a point of intersection on the outer face.
Stated in terms of <m>n</m>-Venn dual graphs, being exposed is 
  the same as the condition 
  that the vertex corresponding to the outer face has degree <m>n</m>.
Clearly, every symmetric Venn diagram must be exposed.
Also, every convex Venn diagram must be exposed 
  (<xref ref="ref-Gr92a">[Gr92a]</xref>).
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-hidden">
<idx><h>curve</h><h>hidden</h></idx>
<statement>
A curve in a non-exposed Venn diagram is <em>hidden</em> if it 
  does not touch the outer region.
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
For example, in Venn's general construction, curves <m>4,5,\ldots,n-1</m>
  are all hidden.
Chilakamarri, Hamburger, and Pippert 
  <xref ref="ref-CHP96b">[CHP96b]</xref> gave an example, shown below,
  of a simple 6-Venn diagram which is not in the same class as
  any exposed diagram.
The hidden curve is the dotted green one.
</p>

<image source="gifs/hidden6.gif"/>

<p>
All simple Venn diagrams with five or less curves are exposed, but with
  five curves there are 8 (5 reducible, 3 irreducible) that do not 
  have a convex drawing in the plane

On his "Math Recreations" website (now defunct), Mark
Thompson proposed the novel problem of finding <em>Venn polyominoes</em>; these
  are Venn diagrams where each curve is the perimeter of an axis-aligned polyomino in an integer grid.  
A polyomino is a generalization of a domino whereby the shape is formed 
  by gluing together unit squares along their edges with no holes allowed.
When considering Venn polyominoes we need to relax the Venn diagram restriction that curves intersect
  only finitely.  
Chow and Ruskey, in <xref ref="ref-CR05">[CR05]</xref>,
  used Venn polyominoes to consider the special case of area-proportional diagrams 
  when all regions have the same area, which can be viewed as being a one unit area.
For this reason, such Venn polyominoes can be called <term>minimum area Venn diagrams</term>.
We will prefer to call them <term>polyVenn diagrams</term>.
Thompson found several examples of <em>congruent</em> polyVenn diagrams for <m>n</m> up to 4 curves, and Chow and Ruskey found
  an example for 5 curves; we show some of these in <xref ref="fig-polyVenn-congruent"/> below.  
Note that only translations of curves are used in (a),(b),(c), but that reflection is used in (d).
Congruent polyVenn diagrams are not know for any <m>n \gt 5</m>.<idx>congruent</idx>
</p>  

<figure xml:id="fig-polyVenn-congruent">

<image source="pdfs/venn_congruent-polyominoes" width="70%" />
</figure>

<p>
Chow and Ruskey <xref ref="ref-CR05">[CR05]</xref> have also found non-congruent polyVenn diagrams for 6 and for 7 curves.
Subsequently, Bultena, Klimesh, and Ruskey <xref ref="ref-BKR">[BKR]</xref> found a couple of general
  constructions which we will describe pictorially below.  
The final "shape" of the polyVenn diagram is a rectangle as per the definition below.
</p>
  
<definition>
<statement>
A <term><m>(r,c)</m>-polyVenn diagram</term> is a polyVenn diagram with <m>n = r+c</m> curves, each of which is the 
  perimeter of a polyomino, all existing in a <m>2^r \times 2^c</m> rectangular <term>base</term> grid.
</statement>
</definition>  

<p>
A <m>(1,2)</m>-polyVenn diagram is shown in <xref ref="fig-Lpoly"/>.  Two depictions are shown.  In the first,
the three polyominoes and their position in the rectangular grid are shown.  In the second, each grid square contains the
labels of the curve interiors that it intersects.  Note also that the empty set occurs as a square within the grid, rather
than as the unbounded exterior region.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
In <xref ref="fig-LpolySmall"/> we show the smallest polyVenn diagrams, using letter labels to indicate the interior of the curves.  
Up to relabelling and rotations/reflections they are unique.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
The sequence of <m>(0,c)</m>-polyVenn diagrams does not continue beyond <m>(0,2)</m> as we prove below.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
There is no <m>(0,c)</m>-polyVenn diagram if <m>c > 2</m>.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
Label the cells <m>1,2,\ldots,2^c</m> and assume that there is a <m>(0,c)</m>-polyVenn diagram.
The polyominoes are all <m>1 \times 2^{c-1}</m> rectangles.
Let <m>c \ge 3</m>.  The uncovered cell (the one corresponding to the empty set) must occur at one of the ends, for
  otherwise two of the rectangles don't intersect; assume that the uncovered cell has label 1. 
Cells 2 and <m>2^c</m> must be covered by two different polyominoes; however, those two polyominoes intersect in only one cell,
  which is a contradiction. 
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
We can expand the (1,2)-polyVenn into a (2,3)-polyVenn by the following <em>expansion</em> process.  
First, double the width and height of the base grid and of each polyomino in the (1,2)-polyVenn as shown in 
  the top row of <xref ref="fig-LpolyExpand"/>.
Each square cell of the (1,2) grid has become a <m>2 \times 2</m> square in the (2,3) grid.
If the two new polyominoes, call them A and B, subdivide each of these <m>2 \times 2</m> squares into the four
  possible interiors <m>\{ \emptyset,A,B,A \cap B \}</m>, then the result is the desired (2,3)-polyVenn.
</p>

<figure xml:id="fig-LpolyExpand" width="80%">
<caption>A <m>(2,3)</m>-polyVenn diagram created by expansion.</caption>
<image source="pdfs/LpolyVennExpand" width="80%" />
</figure>

<p>
In <xref ref="fig-LpolyExpandColumn"/> we show another type of expansion, one that goes from (2,3) to (2,5).
The first 5 polyominoes are derived from <xref ref="fig-LpolyExpand"/> by quadrupling the number of columns, replacing
  each cell by a <m>1 \times 4</m> row of cells.  
This ensures that all <m>2^5</m> possible interior/exterior combinations of those first 5 curves occur, once per each <m>1 \times 4</m> block of cells.
The final two polyominoes, call them A and B, have the <em>cover property</em> that all 4 possible interior exterior combinations of A and B occur within each
  <m>1 \times 4</m> block of cells, and thus that the collection of all 7 curves is a Venn diagram.
</p>

<image source="pdfs/LpolyVennExpandColumn" width="80%" />
</figure>

<theorem xml:id="thm-expand02">
<statement>
For <m>c \geq 2</m>, a <m>(2,c)</m>-polyVenn diagram can be expanded to a <m>(2,c+2)</m>-polyVenn diagram.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
The main ideas can be generalize from our discussion of <xref ref="fig-LpolyExpandColumn"/>.  
Observe that the pattern and cover property of the final two (blue) polyominoes holds for any positive 
  number of columns that is divisible by 4.
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<theorem xml:id="thm-expand11">
<statement>
For <m>r,c \geq 1</m>, a <m>(r,c)</m>-polyVenn diagram can be expanded to a <m>(r+1,c+1)</m>-polyVenn diagram.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
Again, the main ideas can be generalized from the discussion of <xref ref="fig-LpolyExpand"/>.
However, here it is not so clear how the two non-expanded polyominoes, A and B, generalize.
We do this by making use of the progression of polyominoes shown in <xref ref="fig-PolyBette"/>
  (or <xref ref="fig-PolyMatt"/>).
To get a particular size, remove the same number of rows from the top and the bottom from a big enough instance.
For example, the get the two polyominoes in the second row of <xref ref="fig-LpolyExpand"/>, remove the
  top 2 and bottom 2 rows of cells from the <m>8 \times 8</m> polyominoes in <xref ref="fig-PolyBette"/>.
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
Note that the collection of 8 polyominoes in <xref ref="fig-PolyBette"/> or <xref ref="fig-PolyMatt"/> together
  with the <m>(1,1)</m>-polyVenn of <xref ref="fig-LpolySmall"/> form
  <m>(5,5)</m>-polyVenn diagrams after each is expanded enough times to make the base grid <m>32 \time 32</m>.

<p>
We will now argue that <xref ref="thm-expand11"/> and <xref ref="thm-expand02"/> together imply that there are <m>(r,c)</m>-polyVenn diagrams
  for all <m>2 \le r \le c</m>.
The (1,1)- and (1,2)-polyVenn diagrams shown in <xref ref="fig-LpolySmall"/> and <xref ref="fig-Lpoly"/> give us 
  (2,2)- and (2,3)-polyVenn diagrams via <xref ref="thm-expand11"/>, which in turn are the base cases for
  applying <xref ref="thm-expand02"/> to get all <m>(2,c)</m>-polyVenn diagrams for <m>c \ge 2</m>.
The remaining <m>(r,c)</m>-polyVenns for <m>3 \le r \le c</m> are obtained by repeated applications of <xref ref="thm-expand11"/>.
</p>

<p>
We previously discussed the <m>(0,c)</m>-polyVenns, which only exist if <m>c = 0,1,2</m>.
What remains to be considered are the <m>(1,c)</m>-polyVenns where <m>c > 2</m>.
They exist for <m>c = 3</m> and <m>c = 4</m> (see <xref ref="fig-polyVenn13"/> and <xref ref="fig-polyVenn14"/>)
  and we conjecture that they don't exist if <m>c \ge 5</m>.

<p>
A purist might complain that polyVenn diagrams include the empty set as a cell instead of the unbounded exterior.
In certain situations we can modify the constructions discussed above to omit the empty set cell.
In <xref ref="ref-BKR">[BKR]</xref> it is shown how to modify the above construction to prove that if <m>n</m> is
  even, then there is a empty set omitting <m>(2^{n/2}-1) \times (2^{n/2}+1)</m> polyVenn diagram.  
Other instances where <m>2^n-1</m> is a composite number are unresolved.
