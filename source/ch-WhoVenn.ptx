<title>John Venn</title>

<p>
Venn diagrams were introduced in 1880 by
  John Venn (1834-1923), <q>M.A. Fellow and Lecturer in 
  Moral Science, Caius College, Cambridge University</q>,
  in a paper entitled
<em>On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical
Representation of Propositions and Reasonings
</em> which appeared in the Philosophical Magazine and Journal
  of Science S. 5. Vol. 9. No. 59. July 1880, 
  <xref ref="ref-Ve80">[Ve80]</xref>.
</p>

<p>
John Venn was born August 4, 1834 in Hull, Yorkshire, England and
  died April 4, 1923 in Cambridge, England.<fn>Humberside changed to Yorkshire 
  at the suggestion of Keith M. Briggs, "since Humberside did not exist until
  the 1970's".</fn>
He came from a Low Church Evangelical background and
  in 1853 entered Gonville and Caius College of Cambridge University.
In 1857 he was named a Fellow of the college.
He was ordained a priest in 1859 and for a year was curate at Mortlake.
</p>

<p>
He published his first book <em>Symbolic Logic</em> in 1881 and
  <em>The Principles of Empirical Logic</em> in 1889.
In 1883 John Venn was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
</p>

<p>
Venn wrote a history of his college, <em>The Biographical History
  of Gonville and Caius College 1349-1897</em> (1897),
  and then began to compile a history of Cambridge University.
He completed three volumes of the biographical history, and others continued the work,
  with Volume 7 published in 1978, and 
  with the eighth volume reportedly in preparation.

<p>
The use of diagrams in formal logic is not an easy history to trace,
  but it is certain that the diagrams that are popularly associated 
  with Venn, in fact, originated much earlier.  They are rightly associated with
Venn, however, because he comprehensively surveyed and formalized
their usage, and was the first to generalize them.  It is worth noting
that his book <xref ref="ref-Ve80">[Ve80]</xref> is still in print.
For more of the history of Venn diagrams the reader is referred to
the articles by Baron <xref ref="ref-Bar">[Bar]</xref> and Hamburger and Pippert 
  <xref ref="ref-HP00">[HP00]</xref>, and the recent book by Edwards
  <xref ref="ref-Ed04">[Ed04]</xref>.
The first use of the term <term>Venn diagram</term>, according to the
  2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, is in the book
  "A Survey of Symbolic Logic" by Clarence Irving Lewis, 1918.

  is courtesy of the wonderful
  "MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive"

That is a good place to look for more details about him.
For more comprehensive bibliographic information, the thesis 
  <xref ref="ref-Cl">[Cl]</xref> of  Clewlow is recommended.
