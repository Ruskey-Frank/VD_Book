<title>Extending Venn Diagrams</title>

<p>
In this section we are concerned with trying to use an existing <m>n</m>-Venn diagram to produce a Venn diagram with more
than <m>n</m> curves.
</p>

<definition>
<statement>
A <m>n</m>-Venn diagram is <term>reducible</term> if the removal of one of its
  <m>n</m> curves results in a Venn diagram with <m>n-1</m> curves.
A Venn diagram that is not reducible is <term>irreducible</term>.
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
The two general constructions, by their nature, both yield reducible diagrams.
The symmetric ellipse diagram shown in <xref ref="fig-5ellipse-irreducible"/> is irreducible.
Removing curve 4 results in an independent family in which
  the region corresponding to the set {1} is disconnected
  (the cyan shaded region of the figure).
Since the diagram is symmetric, no matter what curve is removed,
  the result is not a Venn diagram.
</p>

<p>
For a long time it was not known whether a reducible Venn diagram
  whose curves are ellipses existed or not;
  such a diagram was discovered by Hamburger and Pippert
  <xref ref="ref-HP00">[HP00]</xref> and is shown below.   WHERE IS IT???
</p>

<definition>
<statement>
A <m>n</m>-Venn diagram <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is <term>extendible</term> if
  there is a curve that can be added to it to make an <m>(n+1)</m>-Venn diagram,
  <m>\mathbf{C}'</m>.
Diagram <m>\mathbf{C}'</m> is said to be an <term>extension</term> of <m>\mathbf{C}</m>.
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
Winkler <xref ref="ref-Wi">[Wi]</xref> makes the following two
  observations:
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-A">
<statement>
For <m>n &gt; 1</m>, a simple <m>n</m>-Venn
  diagram <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is extendible to a simple <m>(n+1)</m>-Venn diagram if
  and only if its Venn dual <m>D(\mathbf{C})</m> is Hamiltonian.
</statement>
</theorem>

<theorem xml:id="thm-B">
<statement>
If the <m>n</m>-Venn diagram <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is an extension
  of an <m>(n-1)</m>-Venn diagram, then <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is extendible to an
  <m>(n+1)</m>-Venn diagram.
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
To prove the latter theorem, let <B>B</B> be the diagram whose extension is
  <B>C</B>.
By <xref ref="thm-A"/>, The curve <m>H</m> added to <m>\mathbf{B}</m> to get <m>\mathbf{C}</m>
  corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in D(<B>B</B>).
In D(<B>C</B>), curve <m>H</m> becomes the
  prism<fn>The prism of a graph <m>G</m> is formed by taking two copies of <m>G</m> and adding a perfect matching whose edges join corresponding copies of vertices.</fn>,
  <m>P</m>, of a cycle of length <m>2^n</m>.
Since the prism of a cycle is Hamiltonian, <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is extendible.
</p>

<p>
Edwards' general construction is a manifestation of this proof of
  <xref ref="thm-B"/>, where the Hamilton cycle in <m>P</m> is the one that alternates
  back and forth between the two copies of the cycle, two vertices at
  a time from each cycle.
Venn's general construction is related but different since it uses
  non-prism edges (see <xref ref="subsec-Duals"/>).
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Winkler's Conjecture</title>

<p>
Winkler <xref ref="ref-Wi">[Wi]</xref> conjectured that every
  simple Venn diagram of <m>n</m> curves can be extended to a
  simple Venn diagram of <m>n+1</m> curves by the addition of a suitable curve.
This conjecture was modified by Grünbaum
  <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref> by removing the restriction
  of simplicity; i.e., his conjecture was that every Venn diagram
  is extendible.
Grünbaum's version was proven by Chilakamarri, Hamburger, and Pippert
  <xref ref="ref-CHP96a">[CHP96a]</xref>, but Winkler's original
  conjecture remains unsettled.
</p>

<p>
The proof of
  <xref ref="ref-CHP96a">[CHP96a]</xref>
  introduces the <term>radual graph</term>, <m>R(\mathbf{C})</m> of the
  Venn diagram, which, for an arbitrary plane graph,
  is the union of the radial graph and the dual graph (Ore
  <xref ref="ref-Or">[Or]</xref> has more information on
  the radial and dual graphs).
A simple example, using Venn diagram #3.4, is shown
  in Figure <xref ref="img-radual"/>.
The strategy of their proof is first to show that <m>R(\mathbf{C})</m> is
  a simple triangulation without separating triangles
  and then invoke a theorem of Whitney
  <xref ref="ref-Wh">[Wh]</xref> that
  any such graph is Hamiltonian.
It is then easy to see that the Hamilton cycle in the radual graph can be
  used as the additional curve.
This sufficient condition is also necessary as stated in this
  analogue of <xref ref="thm-A"/>.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-extendible">
<statement>
For <m>n &gt; 1</m>, a <m>n</m>-Venn
  diagram <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is extendible to a <m>(n+1)</m>-Venn diagram if
  and only if its radual graph <m>R(\mathbf{C})</m> is Hamiltonian.
