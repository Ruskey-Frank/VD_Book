<title>When are two Venn diagrams different?</title>

<p>
Answering this question is a bit subtle and depends on whether the diagrams is
regarded as being embedded in the plane or on a sphere, whether the curves are coloured
or not, and so on.  
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-isomorphic">
<idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>isomorphic</h></idx>
<statement>
Two Venn diagrams are <term>isomorphic</term> if, by a continuous
  transformation of the plane, one of them can be changed into
  the other or its mirror image.
</statement>
</definition>

<definition xml:id="def-equivalent">
<idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>equivalent</h></idx>
<statement>
Two Venn diagrams are <term>equivalent</term> if they are isomorphic
  as plane graphs, ignoring the edge colors
  (that is, isomorphic as planar graphs embedded in the plane).
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
Since curves meet transversally in simple Venn diagrams, two
  simple Venn diagrams are isomorphic if and only if they are
  equivalent.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a Venn diagram may be embedded on the surface of a sphere
  via stereographic projection.
(Consider the standard basketball ball; it is the stereographic projection
  of a simple 3-Venn diagram; adding another great circle, orthogonal to the
  other two, gives Edwards' general construction for <m>n=4</m>.)
Sometimes it is more natural to look at Venn diagrams
  as being embedded on the sphere. 
This topic is explored in <xref ref="subsec-Spherical"/>.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-class">
<idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>class of</h></idx>
<statement>
Two Venn diagrams are <term>in the same class</term> if they can be
  projected to the same spherical Venn diagram.
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
When considering non-simple Venn diagrams there is another elementary
  operation that can sometimes be applied to one diagram to get another.

<title>[rigid diagram, seperable vertex]</title>
<idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>rigid</h></idx>
<idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>seperable vertex in</h></idx>
<statement>
A <term>vertex traversal</term> of a
  vertex <m>v</m> in a Venn diagram is a circular
  sequence <m>C_0, C_1, \ldots, C_m</m> of
  the curves adjacent to <m>v</m>, when read in a clockwise rotation
  around <m>v</m>.
A vertex is said to be <term>separable</term>
  if its vertex traversal has the property that for some <m>i</m>,
  there is a <m>j</m> such that the intersection of
  <m>\mathbf{A} = C_i, C_{i+1}, \ldots, C_{j-1}</m> and
  <m>\mathbf{B} = C_j, C_{j+1}, \ldots, C_{i-1}</m> consists
  of one curve, say <m>C</m>, and in addition, <m>|\mathbf{A}| &gt; 2</m>
  and <m>|\mathbf{B}| &gt; 2</m>.
In the example below the sets <m>\mathbf{A}</m>
and <m>\mathbf{B}</m> are <m>\mathbf{A}</m> = { red, green, black, red, green} and
<m>\mathbf{B}</m> = {blue, yellow, black, blue, yellow}, and the black curve is the curve <m>C</m>.
A Venn diagram is said to be <term>rigid</term> if it has no separable vertices.
The figures below illustrate the operation of <term>splitting</term>
a separable vertex; <term>unsplitting</term> (or <term>joining</term>)is defined as the inverse operation.
</statement>

<p>
Note that the vertex of Figure <xref ref="fig-seperable"></xref> is
  part of a Venn diagram if and only if the two vertices of Figure <xref ref="fig-splitting"></xref>
  are part of a Venn diagram.
Simple diagrams are in many ways the most visually pleasing of Venn diagrams.
Rigid Venn diagrams are interesting because in the equivalence class
  of diagrams under splitting and unsplitting of vertices, they are
  the ones closest to being simple.

<title>An extended example of vertex splitting.</title>

<p>
To make a Venn diagram more simple, we wish to add vertices, which corresponds to adding 
faces (by adding edges) in the dual graph.  Since any face in the Venn dual whose boundary
contains more than four edges corresponds to a vertex of degree greater than four in the Venn
diagram, adding a chord across that face corresponds to splitting the
relevant vertex into two adjacent vertices in the Venn diagram - thus adding one extra vertex
into the diagram and making it closer to being simple. 
</p>

<p>
Consider the symmetric 5-venn diagram shown to the left.  This diagram can be constructed using
the necklace construction ideas on the page <a href="VennNecklaceEJC.html">Symmetric Diagrams, Necklaces, and Chains</a>;
it is very non-simple, but it is also not rigid.  In this subsection, we show how to transform it into the 
unique simple diagram on 5 vertices, shown at the beginning of the section on <a href="VennSymmEJC.html">symmetric diagrams</a>.
The vertex marked with a star is separable, and we will separate it.
</p>

<p>
Below we show the corresponding unlabelled Venn dual (the red edges) overlaying a monochromatic
version of the diagram above, and then the dual graph alone on the right.  In both
graphs the external vertices, corresponding to the external empty region in the Venn diagram,
are identified; we don't join them to emphasize the symmetry of the diagram.

To the right we show how the starred separable vertex above can be separated to create a new 
  vertex - the green and black curves have now formed a new vertex where they intersect, which is
  the second star. 
(Note that the originally starred vertex remains separable.)
The separation corresponds to adding the thin green edge in the Venn dual.
The fact that this can be done without creating any new regions corresponds to the fact
that the vertices in the Venn dual corresponding to the newly neighbouring faces can have
an edge added between them (<em>i.e.</em>, their labels differ by a single bit).
</p>
<image source="pdfs/5venn1splitOverlay"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
Below we show how this edge can be added symmetrically to create five new vertices in the
diagram (on the left) and adding five new edges to the dual (on the right).

</sidebyside>

<p>
Continuing in this fashion, we add edges to the dual graph until no more can be added; at this point
the Venn dual is composed entirely of 4-faces (faces with exactly 4 edges bordering them), implying that
the corresponding Venn diagram is simple.  Following <xref ref="ref-KRSW">[KRSW]</xref>, we
can call this operation <term>quadrangulation</term> since each resulting face is a quadrangle.  The final
diagram is shown below; it is isomorphic to the unique simple symmetric 5-Venn diagram.
