<title>Venn diagrams made from congruent curves</title>

<introduction>
<p>
The first part of this section is more "geometric" than
  "graph theoretic".
We introduce congruent Venn diagrams here because the
  examples are used to illustrate graph theoretic definitions.

<title>Congruent Venn Diagrams</title>

<p>
The general constructions of Venn and Edwards
  outlined on the "What is a Venn Diagram?" page
  do not share a nice property of the first two
  figures on the same page
  (made from circles and triangles),
  namely, that they are constructed from
  congruent<fn>Two figures in the plane are <term>congruent</term>
  if one can be transformed into the other by rotations and translations in the plane.</fn> curves.
Grünbaum
  <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref>
  defines a Venn diagram to be <term>nice</term>
  if it is made from congruent curves, but we'll prefer to
  call them <term>congruent</term> Venn diagrams.
The first such diagrams were constructed by
Grünbaum in the seminal paper [<A HREF="VennRefs.html#Gr75">Gr75</A>].
In <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref>
  he discussed examples of congruent diagrams for up to 8 curves; many symmetric examples can be
  found in the <xref ref="ch-VennSymmetric"/>.

<p>
Hamburger and Pippert <href ref="ref-HP97">[HP97]</href>
proved that there are simple reducible Venn diagrams with
5 congruent ellipses, in spite of the fact that Venn had stated
that there are no such diagrams.
In fact, there are two of them, but they are in the same class: one
of their diagrams is shown to to the right.
</p>

<p>
Below we show a redrawing of Grünbaum's
beautiful congruent Venn diagram (from <href ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</href>) made from 5
  congruent ellipses which also has a rotational symmetry.
The diagram on the left labels each region with the labels of all ellipses
  that contain the region.
On the right, the regions are colored
  according to the number of ellipses in which they are
  contained: white (the external region) = 0, yellow = 1,
  red = 2, blue = 3, green = 4, and black = 5.
Note that the number of regions colored with a given color corresponds to
  the appropriate binomial coefficient: #(white) = #(black) = 1,
  #(yellow) = #(green) = 5, and #(red) = #(blue) = 10.

<title>Venn diagrams and "Revolving Door" lists</title>

<p>
Note that some of the blue regions in the ellipse diagram above are
  "adjacent" in the sense that their boundary shares a common
  point.
The sets corresponding to these regions differ by one element.
The point of intersection acts like a "revolving door"; one element
  is removed from the subset, another element is added.
Sometimes these adjacent regions form a "cycle", as in the diagram
  above.
Another way of looking at the cycle is as the subgraph of
  the square<fn>The <term>square</term> of a graph <m>G</m>, denoted <m>G^2</m>, is
  the graph obtained by adding to the edge set of <m>G</m> edges between vertices that are
  at distance 2 in <m>G</m></fn>,
  <m>D(\mathbf{C})^2</m>, of the Venn dual induced
  by those vertices corresponding to <m>k</m>-subsets.
These cycles give us revolving door listings of all the <I>k</I>-subsets
  of <m>n</m>.
Revolving door algorithms for listing various
  classes of <m>k</m>-subsets have been developed by a variety of
  researchers <xref ref="ref-NW">[NW]</xref>, <xref ref="ref-Kn">[Kn]</xref>.
Below we list the subsets corresponding to the 1,2,3,4-subsets
  (yellow, red, blue, green) in the above diagram in a counter-clockwise rotation.

<p>
Because of the symmetry of the diagram,
  these circular listings have the property that they remain invariant
  when acted on by the cyclic permutation <m>(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5)</m>.
These listings are related to combinatorial Gray codes; since Gray codes
  have many connections with symmetric diagrams we describe them further on the Variants
  on Symmetry page, <xref ref="sec-SymmVariant"/>.
