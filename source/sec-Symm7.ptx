<p>
Referring to the case <m>n=7</m>, Grünbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75,p.19]</xref> wrote:
  "at present it seems likely that no such diagram exists."
However, Grünbaum himself later found examples of such diagrams 
  <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref> and
  in 1992 additional examples were also discovered by Anthony 
  Edwards and independently by Carla Savage and Peter Winkler.
In this section we summarize what is know about symmetric 7-Venn diagrams.
They can be classified in various ways depending on whether they are
  monotone or non-monotone, and simple or non-simple, and we will have
  a sub-section on each of those 4 possibilities.

<subsection>
<title>The Grünbaum encoding</title>

<p>
The Grünbaum encoding of a simple symmetric Venn diagram consists of four
  <m>n</m>-ary strings, call them <m>\mathbf{w}</m>, <m>\mathbf{x}</m>,
  <m>\mathbf{y}</m>, <m>\mathbf{z}</m>, each of length 
  <m>(2^{n+1}-4)/n</m>.   
String <m>\mathbf{w}</m> is obtained by first numbering the curves clockwise as
  they appear on the outer face, and then following curve <m>n</m>,
  recording its intersections with each of the other curves.
The other strings are obtained by going counter-clockwise and/or  
  starting with one of the innermost curves; in each case the curves
  must be re-numbered first.
For the 3 circle diagram <m>\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{z} = 1212</m>.
For the 5 ellipse diagram at the top of this page, the strings of the 
  Grünbaum encoding are
</p>

<md>
  <mrow>
  \amp w = z = 142413141324 \text{ and }
  </mrow>
  <mrow>
  \amp x = y = 132414241314.
  </mrow>
</md>

<p>
Of course, we really only need two of the strings, one starting at the
  inside and one at the outside, since <m>\mathbf{w}</m> can be inferred from
  <m>\mathbf{x}</m>, and <m>\mathbf{y}</m> from <m>\mathbf{z}</m> -- but it's convenient to have
  all four, particularly when checking a diagram by hand.
How can <m>\mathbf{x}</m> be obtained from <m>\mathbf{w}</m> in general?
Think of the strings as being indexed <m>i = 1,2,\ldots,M</m>.
The rule is <m>\mathbf{x}[i] = n-\mathbf{w}[M-i+1]</m>.
</p>

<p>
In fact, only one string is required, since string <m>\mathbf{y}</m> is a circular
  rotation of <m>\mathbf{x}</m>. 
The starting position of <m>\mathbf{y}</m> can be determined as the unique position
  in <m>\mathbf{x}</m> where all curves have been encountered an odd number of times 
  (thus implying that we're on the inside of all curves).
In the 5 ellipse example, the starting position of <m>\mathbf{y}</m> is the rightmost
  1 in <m>\mathbf{x}</m>. 
If a single string is chosen to be the representative, then we take the
  lexicographically least of all four.
</p>

<p>
This encoding scheme has its parallels in other disciplines: topologists may 
  recognise the Grünbaum encoding as being closely
  related to the <term>Gauss code</term> of a knot<sup><a href="VennFootEJC.html#gauss_code">10</a></sup>.
</p>

<!-- <P>
A closely related encoding is the <I>G-encoding</I> which is obtained
  by following a curve from the interior/exterior face, numbering and
  recording the curves in the order that they are encountered.
Each string of the encoding is a restricted
  growth string [<A HREF="VennRefs.html#COS">COS</A>],
  meaning that each number is at most one greater than
  the values that precede it, with the first value being 0 (except that
  we take the first value to be 1).
The four strings corresponding to the 5 ellipse example are:
<blockquote>
  <B>w</B> = <B>z</B> = 123214121432 and <BR>
  <B>x</B> = <B>y</B> = 123414341214.
</blockquote> -->

<p>
Tao Cao proved in <xref ref="ref-Ca">[Ca]</xref> that for simple 
  symmetric monotone Venn diagrams, the Grünbaum encoding uniquely identifies the
  diagram (up to isomorphism of plane graphs).

<title>Simple Symmetric 7-Venn Diagrams</title>

<subsubsection>
<title>Simple monotone polar symmetric 7-Venn diagrams</title>

<p>
For <m>n=7</m>, all simple monotone symmetric Venn diagrams with polar symmetry 
  are known; there are six of them, and they are listed below.
The first five were discovered by Anthony Edwards using a program to generate
  candidate diagrams and manual checking to eliminate those candidates that
  were not Venn diagrams <xref ref="ref-Ed96">[Ed96]</xref>; however 
  one, Hamilton, was first found constructed by hand by Edwards.  
He named them after the cities in which they were discovered and we
  follow his naming convention (but also number them P1-P6).
Grünbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr92b">[Gr92b]</xref> also discovered "Adelaide".
An exhaustive computer search by Frank Ruskey uncovered another, 
  "Victoria", that had been overlooked in Edwards' manual checking.

<title>Non-monotone simple symmetric 7-Venn diagrams</title>

<p>
Branko Grünbaum was the first to discover a non-monotone symmetric
  7-Venn diagram.
The exact number of symmetric 7-Venn diagrams is not known, but there
  is strong evidence to suggest that there are 33 of them.
The reason for this belief is that Stirling Chow conducted a "hill-climbing" algorithm with randomized choices; 
  this algorithm was run thousands of times without ever discovering more than the 33 that it found in initial runs.

<p>
Computer searches by Stiring Chow have uncovered many other non-monotone simple symmetric
  7-Venn diagrams.  
One of them is illustrated in the figures below.

<subsection>
<title>Non-simple symmetric 7-Venn diagrams</title>

<p>
From computer searches it is apparent that there are many more
  non-simple diagrams than there are simple diagrams.  
Using the above techniques, in <xref ref="ref-We03">[We03]</xref> the authors generated
  hundreds of thousands of distinct non-simple monotone symmetric 7-Venn diagrams, including
  1576 rigid diagrams (both polar symmetric and not).
An example is shown in <xref ref="img-7-VD-polar-rigid"/>.
</p>

<figure xml:id="img-7-VD-polar-rigid" width="50%">
<caption>
A polar symmetric rigid monotone symmetric 7-Venn diagram from
<xref ref="ref-We03">[We03]</xref>.  
This diagram has the minimum number of vertices for a monotone diagram.
</caption>
<image source="pngs/7-VD-polar-rigid.png"></image>
</figure>

<p>
For <m>n=7</m>, the value of
  <m>\lceil (2^n-2)/(n-1) \rceil</m> is 21, which is
  is divisible by 7.
It is thus possible that there is a
  minimum vertex symmetric Venn diagram in which every curve passes through
  every vertex.
In fact, we have discovered 60 such diagrams, but all 
  discovered so far are non-rigid.
Illustrations of two of them are found in 
  <xref ref="img-min7a"/>, <xref ref="img-min7aC"/>, <xref ref="img-min7b"/>, and <xref ref="img-min7bC"/>
</p>
 
<p>
Hamburger and Pippert, in <xref ref="ref-HP03">[HP03]</xref>, using different methods
  than those above, also constructed a minimum-vertex non-monotone
  symmetric 7-Venn diagram with several nice features.  Their diagram is not rigid either.
