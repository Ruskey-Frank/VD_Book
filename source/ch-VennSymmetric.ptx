<title>Symmetric Venn Diagrams A</title>

<introduction>
<p>
The main focus in this chapter are Venn diagrams that have rotational symmetry.
There are general results for non-simple diagrams and results for small <m>n</m>
  when the diagram is simple.
In the final section we will consider diagrams embedded on the sphere.
