  Almost everyone has been exposed to Venn diagrams as part of their schooling.
  It is less well-known are that Venn diagrams exist for more than 3 categories or that
  interesting mathematics arises from their careful study.
  </p>
  <p>
  Venn introduced his diagrams around 1880, but it wasn't until the pioneering papers
  of Branko Grunbaum, starting in 1975, that the mathematical study of Venn diagrams
  really took off.  
  </p>
  <p>
  Much of the material in this book first appeared in the "Survey of Venn Diagrams" that was
  published as a "Dynamic Survey", in the Electronic Journal of Combintorics as the fifth
  dynamic survey and the only one that was a collection of html pages and not a pdf document.
  The original survey was first published in 1997 and had updates in 2001 and 2005.  The
  last update was co-authored with my former Ph.D. student, Mark Weston.
