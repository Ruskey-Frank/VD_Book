  Almost everyone has been exposed to Venn diagrams as part of their schooling.
  It is less well-known are that Venn diagrams exist for more than 3 categories or that
  interesting mathematics arises from their careful study.
  </p>
  <p>
  Venn introduced his diagrams around 1880, but it wasn't until the pioneering papers
  of Branko Grünbaum, starting in 1975, that the mathematical study of Venn diagrams
  really took off.  
  </p>
  <p>
  I was first exposed to Branko's work much later.  Although I wasn't a geometer, I received the
  announcements from the University of Washington of their geometry/combinatorics seminars, and
  of course, had heard of Branko and Victor Klee, who were prominent mathematicians at U of W.
  Victoria is geographically close to Seattle, and there were some mathematical meetings that were
    organized in the geographic region.
  At the time I was keenly interesting in combinatorial Gray codes, and when an announcement
    came around about a professor from Cambridge University giving a talk about Venn Diagrams,
    in which the abstract mentioned Gray codes, I was intrigued even though I couldn't travel 
    to Seattle then because of teaching commitments.  
  So I called Branko and asked him whether his speaker might be willing to travel to Victoria 
    and give the talk at the University of Victoria.
  </p>
  <p>
  The speaker was Anthony Edwards and his talk was about his results about Venn diagrams, which
    included his general construction and it's shifted cousin (which is where the Gray codes came
    in), and about his search for seven curve rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams with an additional mirror-image
    symmetry, of which there were five.
  He also mentioned the open problem of finding an eleven curve rotationally symmetric Venn diagram,
    then next one possible, since such diagrams required a number of curves that is prime.
  </p>
  <p>
  His search technique in some sense amounted to a interative exhaustive search through certain sets of 
    constrained combinations.
  I was an expert in exhaustively listing combinations and brazenly thought that I would be able to
    solve his open problem without much effort.  How wrong I was!
  I was able to show that his list of five diagrams was short; i.e., that there was a missing sixth
    diagram.
  But it was not until many years later, in 20??, that my grad student Khalegh Mamakani, was able to 
    solve the problem for eleven curves.
  </p>
  <p>
  Much of the material in this book first appeared in the <q>Survey of Venn Diagrams</q> that was
  published as a <q>Dynamic Survey</q>, in the Electronic Journal of Combintorics as the fifth
  dynamic survey and the only one that was a collection of html pages and not a pdf document.
  The original survey was first published in 1997 and had updates in 2001 and 2005.  The
  last update was co-authored with my former Ph.D. student, Mark Weston.  
  </p>
  <p>
  The purpose of this book is to put together much of what is known about Venn diagrams from a
  mathematical perspective into one place that researchers and students can reference.
  It is hoped that it will spur further research into the area.  With that in mind, there is
  an extensive collection of open problems at the end of the book.

    Frank is a retired professor of Computer Science at the University of Victoria (UVic).  He completed his Ph.D. at the
    University of California at San Diego under the supervision of T.C. Hu in the department of Applied
    Physics and Information Science in 1978.  His first appointment at UVic was also in 1978 in the Department of
    Mathematics, teaching various Computer Science courses.  After a couple of years, the Department of Computer Science
    was established and he was one of the founding six members.  He remained with the department until his retirement in 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
    His research interests fall into the area of combinatorial algorithms and mathematics, with particular interest in
    combinatorial Gray codes, Venn diagrams, Tatami tilings, nested recurrence relations, and enumerative combinatorics.
    In his spare times he likes to play basketball, spend time at his off-grid cabin pretending to be a hunter-gatherer,
    and to spend time with his children and grand child.
