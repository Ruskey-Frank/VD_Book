There is a much richer set of symmetries of the sphere than there on the plane, and it is natural to 
  investigate whether these additional symmetries can be possessed by Venn diagrams.
As the reader works their way through this subsection, it can be useful to have actual
  spheres to hold and view.
The author once bought a gross of white ping pong balls to draw on while investigating
  spherical Venn diagrams with his grad students!

Let's consider a few examples of <m>n</m>-Venn diagrams for small <m>n</m>.  
The case of <m>n=1</m> is rather uninteresting since a circle in the plane has infintely many symmetries,
  both reflections and rotations.
For <m>n=2</m> things are rather more interesting. 
In the plane, the standard two circle diagram has 4 symmetries,  based on reflections about a line through
  the centers of the circles, and about a line through the 2 points of intersection.
See <xref ref="fig-2vennSphere"/>.
It is interesting that reflection about the horizontal axis leaves the colors of the circles fixed,
  whereas the vertical reflection necessitates a color swap.
Here the group of symmetries is Known as the Klein <m>4</m>-group.
However, on the sphere, the diagram can be drawn as 2 great circles, which intersect perpendicularly at
  two antipodal points (the poles), as in <xref ref="fig-2vennSphere"/>.

<idx>fundamental domain</idx>
On the sphere there a clearly many more symmetries for the 2-Venn diagram, but how many exactly?
Symmetries are obtained by rotating and reflecting.   
Rotations occur in increments of <m>\pi/4</m> radians about the polar axis, and by
  rotating <m>\pi/2</m> about axes that intersect the equator at antipodal points; these points are
  located where the equator intersects a curve (two axes) and at the half-way points between two points of intersection with
  the equator (another two axes).
Reflections can be about a plane through the equator, and planes through the poles and one of the eight points along
  the equator mentioned before.
The effect of these rotations/reflections and their compositions is that the light blue region, which makes up 1/16 of the sphere
  (a seqment of the curve is included with this region) can be mapped to any
  of the 16 such regions, which makes up the entire sphere.
The light blue region of the sphere is known as a <term>fundamental domain</term>. 
Thus we get a much richer set of symmetries for the 2-Venn diagram on the sphere, 4 on the plane versus 16 of them
  on the sphere.

<idx>octahedron</idx>
<idx>cube</idx>
Moving on to <m>n=3</m>, first, what is the set of symmetries in the plane?
It is not hard to see that there are 6 of them, using rotations by <m>2\pi/3</m> and reflection about lines through the
  centers of the circles and the center of the diagram as a whole.
See <xref ref="fig-3vennAxes"/>.
To move things into 3 dimensions, we make the equator in <xref ref="fig-2vennSphere"/> into a blue curve,
  as shown in <xref ref="fig-3vennSphere"/>.
Now what is the group of symmetries?
If we join the 6 points of intersection in <xref ref="fig-3vennSphere"/> with straight lines instead of
  circular arcs, then we obtain an octahedron.
The dual of an octahedron is a 3-cube.
Thus the symmetries are those of the cube, and so there are 48 of them!
Another way to see this is to consider the fundamental domain, shown as a lightly shaded triangle like area in
  <xref ref="fig-3vennSphere"/> including the blue circular arc at the bottom of the triangle.
The entire sphere can be covered with 48 of these areas, modulo a recoloring of the curve.
To make it clearer that the fundamental domain covers <m>1/6</m> of a Venn diagram region, it is also
  shown in <xref ref="fig-3vennAxes"/>.
Again, there is a much richer set of symmetries when a Venn diagram is embedded on the sphere instead of the plane.
</p>

<p>
For <m>n=4</m> there is only one simple Venn diagram, and it's most symmetric rendering is from the 
  Edwards construction, as in <xref ref="fig-EdwardsBipartite"/>.
On the sphere, we are adding a new curve that intersects the equator in 4 places.

<idx>involution</idx>
<idx>antipodal</idx>
The systematic mathematical study of symmetries of Venn diagrams on the sphere was initiated in Mark Weston's PhD thesis,
   <href ref="ref-We09">[We09]</href>.
Some results of the thesis are reported in <href ref="ref-RW11">[RW11]</href>.  
An <term>involution</term> is a self-inverse mapping.
Amongst isometric mappings of the sphere onto itself, the involutory mappings fall into three categories:
  reflections about a plane through a great circle, reflections about a line through the center of the
  sphere, and reflections through the center of the sphere.
We will refer to the symmetry of reflections through the center of the sphere as <term>antipodal symmetry</term>, since
  antipodal points are mapped to each other.

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
For every <m>n \ge 1</m> there is an <m>n</m>-Venn diagram with antipodal symmetry.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>

In this paper we give a construction, for any n, of an n-Venn diagram on the sphere that has antipodal symmetry; 
that is, the diagram is fixed by the map that takes a point on the sphere to the corresponding antipodal point. 
Thus, along with certain diagrams due to Anthony Edwards which can be drawn with rotational and reflective symmetry, 
for any isometry of the sphere that is an involution, there exists an n-Venn diagram on the sphere invariant under that involution. 
Our construction uses a recursively defined chain decomposition of the Boolean lattice.
</p>

<p>
Mathematicians have studies the possible symmetries of the sphere in great detail and it turns out that there
  are 14 of them.
