  <title>What is a Venn Diagram?</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>The first section of this chapter defines independent sets, and then Venn diagrams.  
    We then show a couple of inductive constructions of Venn diagrams with <m>n</m> curves, for any integer <m>n</m>.
    There also is a small section on the Borromean Rings.</p>

<section xml:id="sec-defs">
<title>Definition of Venn Diagrams</title>

<p>
In a series of papers, starting with <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref> Branko Grünbaum, a well known geometer 
  at the University of Washington, initiated the mathematical investigation of Venn diagrams.  We will 
  follow Grünbaum in first defining a more general concept, that of an independent family, 
  and then move on to Venn diagrams.
Both concepts are defined in terms of <term>simple closed curves</term> in the plane, which can be thought of as
  being drawn by starting at a point <m>x</m>, and then drawing a non-intersecting curve that ends back at <m>x</m>.
The Jordan curve theorem states that such a curve <m>C</m> partitions the plane into <m>C</m>, together with two disjoint open regions 
  <m>int(C)</m>, the <term>interior</term> of <m>C</m>, and <m>ext(C)</m>, the (unbounded) exterior of <m>C</m>.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-IndependentFamily">
<idx>independent family</idx>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>\mathbf{C} = \{ C_1, C_2, \cdots, C_n \}</m>
  be a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane.
The collection <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is said to be an <term>independent family</term>
  if the <em>region</em> formed by the intersection of <m>X_1 \cap X_2 \cap \cdots \cap X_n</m>
  is non-empty, where each <m>X_i</m> is either <m>int(C_i)</m>
  or is <m>ext(C_i)</m>.
If, in addition, each such intersection region is connected and there are only
  finitely many points of intersection between curves, then <B>C</B> is a <term>Venn diagram</term>,
  or an <m>n</m>-Venn diagram if we wish to
  emphasize the number of curves in the diagram.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
Note that the term <term>region</term> in the mathematical literature is often assumed to be
  connected; when discussing Venn diagrams no confusion should arise.
Since there are 2 choices for each <m>X_i</m>, there are <m>2^n</m> non-empty disjoint regions that result from the different intersections 
  in the definition.  
One region, the one arising from the intersection of all the exteriors, is unbounded and all of the
  other regions are bounded.
In a Venn diagram all regions are required to be <term>connected</term>, 
  meaning that there is a curve joining any two points in a region, a curve that is 
  entirely contained in the region.
The condition that there are only a finite number of intersection points
  is usually assumed in the literature, but sometimes not stated explicitly.
It rules out, e.g., segments of curves from intersecting.
We will relax this restriction in <xref ref="sec-MinArea"/>.
</p>

<p>
<idx>Euler diagram</idx>
Note that some authors refer to diagrams
with <em>fewer</em> than <m>2^n</m> non-empty regions as Venn diagrams, but they are more properly termed
<term>Euler diagrams</term>, after the mathematician Leonard Euler.  More on these important diagrams can be
found in <xref ref="sec-Euler"/>, Generalizations and Extensions of Venn Diagrams.
We refer to a region enclosed by exactly <m>k</m> curves as a <m>k</m>-region or <m>k</m>-set.

Above we show the most familiar of all Venn diagrams.
In this case <m>n=3</m>, the simple closed curves are all circles,
  and in <xref ref="fig-V3"/> the 8 regions have been labelled with
  the interiors that are included in each intersection.
The eighth region is the exterior region, corresponding to the empty set.
In <xref ref="fig-V3-bitstring"/>, regions have been labelled with bitstrings (binary strings)
  of length <m>n</m>, where inclusion in A is indicated by the first bit, B by the second bit,
  and C by the third bit.
This labelling will also be used often in the sequel.
The colored diagram <xref ref="fig-CO-V3"/> has all 1-sets colored yellow, all 2-sets red,
  and the 3-set blue.
Thus there is 1 0-set, 3 1-sets, 3 2-sets, and 1 3-sets.
The 3 circle Venn diagram also occurs as a minimal projection of the
  Borromean Rings, see <xref ref="sec-Borromean"/>.

<idx><h>Venn diagram</h><h>simple</h></idx>
<statement>
<p>
A <term>simple</term> Venn diagram is one in which
no more than two curves intersect at a common point.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
Simple diagrams are in some sense the <q>nicest</q> as they are easiest to draw and understand.
All of the figures in this chapter are simple, but we will see many examples
in other chapters of non-simple diagrams.  Unless stated otherwise, we assume that Venn diagrams are simple.
</p>

<p>
You often see 2, and 3 curve Venn diagrams drawn with circles, but all diagrams with 4 circles
seem to have the wrong number of regions.  In the next chapter we'll prove a little theorem that implies that
a 4-Venn diagram can never be drawn with circles, even if they have varying diameters.  The basic reason
is that there are too many regions for the possible number of intersections.  Below we make two observations.
The reader is encouraged to try to figure out why these are true.
</p>

<definition>
<p>
Suppose two curves intersect at a point <m>x</m>.  The curves can cross at <m>x</m>, in which case
  we say that they intersect <term>transversally</term>.  If they do not cross, then we say that they
  intersect <term>non-transversally</term>, or that they <term>kiss</term>.<idx>transversal intersection</idx>
</p>
</definition>

<observation xml:id="obs-transverse">
<statement>
<p>
In a simple Venn diagram, at every point of intersection, the two curves meet transversally.
I.e., the two curves cross and do not meerly <q>kiss</q> each other.
More generally, at any point of intersection in a Venn diagram,
  there must be at least two curves that meet transversally.
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
Suppose that curve <m>A</m> kisses curve <m>B</m> at point <m>x</m> in Venn diagram <m>V</m>.
In a rotation about <m>x</m> there are 4 regions, which we may denote <m>AA</m>, <m>AB</m>, <m>BB</m>, and <m>BA</m>.
Unless <m>AB</m> and <m>BA</m> are connected we can not have a Venn diagram since these regions are in the
same set of interiors and exteriors of curves.  We will show that they are not connected, a contradiction
which will prove the observation.
Because <m>V</m> is a Venn diagram, curves <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must have at least two transverse intersections,
for otherwise one curve would be contained in the other.   Define a closed curve <m>C</m> by following curve <m>A</m> 
with region <m>AB</m> on its boundary until first encountering a transverse intersection <m>y</m> with <m>B</m>, 
and then follow <m>B</m> back to <m>x</m>.  The curve <m>C</m> might have points of kissing, but
no transverse intersections.  To finish the proof, observe that <m>C</m> contains region <m>AB</m> but excludes region <m>BA</m>, and thus
they are not connected.  The more general statement may be proven by essentially the same proof.
</p>
</proof>
</observation>

<observation xml:id="obs-maxn">
<statement>
<p>
At most <m>n</m> curves pass through any point of intersection in a <m>n</m>-Venn diagram.
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
Since the curves are simple closed Jordan curves, they do not self-intersect, and thus pass through
any point at most once.
</p>
</proof>
</observation>


<!--
<theorem>
<statement>
Let <m>F</m> be a family of curves with the propery that no two finitely intersecting curves from <m>F</m> intersect
in more than <m>k</m> points.  Then there is no simple <m>n</m>-Venn diagram drawable with curves from <m>F</m> unless
<me>
k {n \choose 2} \ge 2^n - 2.
</me>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
In an <m>n</m>-Venn diagram there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> pairs of curves, so the maximum number of intersections using
curves from <m>F</m> is <m>{n \choose 2}</m>.  On the other hand, there are exactly <m>2^n-2</m> points of intersection in a
simple <m>n</m>-Venn diagram.
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>
-->

<p>
The reason that Venn wanted his diagrams to have all <m>2^n</m> non-empty is that he would shade any
regions that were excluded from the syllogism under consideration.  We can also regard these shaded Venn diagrams
as representing a set system; that is, one of the <m>2^{2^n}</m> sets of subsets of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m>.
If a region is not shaded, then the corresponding set of interiors is in the set system.
We use set systems when comparing Venn and Euler diagrams in <xref ref="sec-Euler"/>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we note that the 3-circle diagram shown above, and the 2-circle diagram for 2 sets, appear often in
the context of illustrating simple logical arguments.  Readers interested in the applications of Venn
diagrams to logical arguments are referred to the excellent introductory article by Glassner <xref ref="ref-Gl">[Gl]</xref>, 
the book by Shin <xref ref="ref-Sh">[Sh]</xref>, and many standard logic textbooks.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Families of Intersecting Simple Curves</title>

<p>
It is sometimes convenient to consider wider families of curves when proving results about Venn diagrams, such as
  independent families.
We define another such family below.
</p>

<definition>
<idx>FISC</idx>
<idx><h>FISC</h><h>simple</h></idx>
<idx><h>FISC</h><h>convex</h></idx>
<statement>
A <term>family of simple curves</term> (or a <term>FISC</term>) is a collection of finitely-intersecting simple closed
  curves in the plane, with the property that there is some open region common to the interior of all the curves.
A FISC is <term>simple</term> if at every point of intersection exactly two curves meet, and they cross each other
  transversally.
A FISC is <term>convex</term> if each curve is convex.
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
Clearly, every independent family is a FISC, but not every Euler diagram.
</p>

<section xml:id="sec-VennExist">
<title>Constructions of Venn Diagrams</title>

<p>
In this section we first discuss how to nicely draw diagrams with two or three circles,
and some connections of these diagrams with geometry and other areas.  Then we discuss the
two most well-known techniques for drawing Venn diagrams with any positive number of curves.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>How to draw a 2 or 3 circle Venn diagram</title>

<p>
Given a compass, it is easy to draw a nice looking two circle Venn diagram as follows.
First draw a circle centered at some point <m>x</m>.  Now draw a second circle of equal radius whose
center lies on the first circle.  The new circle will pass through <m>x</m>.
The region of intersection has been given several names including <term>vesica piscis</term> and
<term>mandorla</term>.<idx>vesica piscis</idx><idx>mandorla</idx>
In Latin vesica is <q>bladder</q> and piscis is <q>fish</q>, and mandorla is Italian for <q>almond</q>.
This shape was known to the ancient Greeks, and found use in early Christian imagery.
</p>

<p>
To draw a three circle Venn diagram one can start with the drawing of a two circle diagram
and then add a circle of equal radius and centered at one of the points of intersection
of the two circles.  Effectively, that is how the diagram of <xref ref="fig-V3"/> was
produced.  In this case the central region of intersection (the blue region of
<xref ref="fig-CO-V3"/>) is known as a <term>Reuleaux triangle</term>.<idx>Reuleaux triangle</idx>
It is an example of a curve of constant width, meaning that if the object is placed 
between two parallel tangential lines, then the lines are equidistant, no mater the orientation
of the parallel lines.  This property is why they are used in the design of drill bits for drilling
rounded square holes; e.g., H.J. Watts' 1917 US patent 1,241,176.  
(There is a widespread misconception that the piston of Wankel engine
is a Reuleaux triangle; they look similar but are not mathematically identical.)
</p>

</subsection>

<p>
Above we saw that Venn diagrams exist for <m>n = 3</m>, and it is
  easy to see (for example, by removing circles) that Venn
  diagrams exist for <m>n=0,1,2</m>.
Diagrams exist for all larger values of <m>n</m> as well.
There have been
  several general constructions published (see <xref ref="ref-Be">[Be]</xref>,
  <xref ref="ref-RRS">[RRS]</xref>, <xref ref="ref-Mo">[Mo]</xref>, <xref ref="ref-AC">[AC]</xref>, and
  <xref ref="ref-FGK">[FGK]</xref>, for a sampling in chronological order); we explain two of them
  below.  
They both have the nice property that they produce simple diagrams and have easy to explain inductive constructions.
In both cases, a new curve is added by drawing a new curve <m>C_n</m> that <q>follows</q> an existing curve <m>C_i</m>; in one case, 
  <m>i=1</m> and in the other case <m>i=n-1</m>.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Venn's Construction</title>

<sidebyside>
<p>
Venn's construction, outlined in his original paper
  <xref ref="ref-Ve80">[Ve80]</xref>, is best
  explained by considering the figure to the right.
Start with the 3 circle diagram.
Curves are successively added, with the new curve tracing the
  one last added and dividing each existing region in two.
In the figure they are added in the order blue (4), red (5),
  and green (6).
It should be clear where the seventh curve would be drawn.

<figure xml:id="fig-Edwards7colored">
<caption>Edwards 7-Venn construction.</caption>
<image source="pdfs/Edwards7colored" width="80%"></image>
</figure>

<p>
Anthony Edwards <xref ref="ref-Ed89a">[Ed89a]</xref>,
  <xref ref="ref-Ed89b">[Ed89b]</xref> developed another general
  inductive construction that has several nice properties,
  including some symmetry.
It is also best explained by means of an example; refer to
  the diagram in <xref ref="fig-Edwards7colored"/>.
For <m>n=2</m> the diagram consists of two perpendicular lines.
(Strictly speaking we have to join the endpoints of these lines to make
  them into simple closed curves.)
For <m>n=3</m> a circle is added, centered at the point of intersection of the lines.
Successive curves will all be added that follow this circle,
  weaving back and forth along the circle, again dividing each
  region in two.
For <m>n = 4,5,6,7</m> the blue, red, green and magenta curves are added,
  in that order.
</p>

<p>
These diagrams have very attractive bipartite colourings as can be
  seen below.
If the region is interior to an odd number of curves, then it is colored blue;
  otherwise, it is white.
The reason for calling these colourings "bipartite" is explained in 
  <xref ref="ch-VennGraphs">Chapter</xref>, Graphs Associated with Venn
  Diagrams.

<p>
Topologically equivalent constructions had been discovered ealier than Edwards' cogwheels, but these
  do not have the same aesthetic appeal as Edwards' diagrams.
For example, see the convex polygons of <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref> and <xref ref="ref-FGK">[FGK]</xref>.
Futher references are <xref ref="ref-PS">[PS]</xref> and <xref ref="ref-Hu">[Hu]</xref>
Also, Edwards' diagrams have an interesting "phase-shifted" variant that we will explore later and which
  are nicely explained in his book <xref ref="ref-Ed04">[Ed04]</xref>.

<title>Venn Diagrams and Knots</title>

<p>
<idx>link</idx>
Every simple Venn diagram can be <q>woven</q> in to a
  link<fn><idx>link</idx>A <term>link</term> is a finite collection of non-intersecting knots 
  (where a <em>knot</em> is a closed, non-self-intersecting curve that is embedded in three dimensions.</fn>;
  as one traverses any curve, the other curves
  alternately go over and under.
The reader will find it an interesting exercise to prove
  that this is always possible for any collection of
  simple closed curves in the plane.
For example, below we show the link that arises (after
  some smooth transformations in 3-space) from Venn's
  general construction for <m>n=4</m>.
This is clearly the same as the link that arises from
  Edwards' general construction for <m>n=4</m>, although
  the constructions give different links for <m>n \ge 5</m>.

<title>Borromean Rings</title>

<p>
The Borromean rings consists of three interlocking rings, with
  the property that if any one of them is removed, then all
  three separate.
The name Borromean comes from the Borromeo family of Renaissance
  Italy, who used them as their family "crest".
Below we show the Borromean rings.
The shadow, a minimal projection of the rings,
  is the familiar 3-Venn diagram.
By <term>minimal</term> projection of a knot or link onto the plane
  we simply mean a projection that has the least number of
  intersections.
</p>

<image source="gifs/BorRings"></image>

<p>
Below are two other illustrations of the Borromean rings.
The one on the left is not a minimal projection
  (and isn't a Venn diagram).
On the right is a rendering that has a great deal of symmetry as
  an object in three dimensional space.

There is another interesting historical context in which the
  rings arise.
The diagram was found in picture-stones on Gotland, an island
  in the Baltic sea off the southeast coast of Sweden.
These are dated around the ninth century and are thought to
  tell tales from the Norse myths.
To the Norse people of Scandinavia, a drawing of the Borromean
  rings using triangles is known as <q>Odin's triangle</q> of the
  <q>Walknot</q> (or <q>valknut</q> -- the knot of the slain).
The symbol was also carved on the bedposts used in their burials
  at sea.
