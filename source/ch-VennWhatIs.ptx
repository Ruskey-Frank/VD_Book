  <title>What is a Venn Diagram?</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>The first section of this chapter defines independent sets, and then Venn diagrams.  
    We then show a couple of inductive constructions of Venn diagrams with <m>n</m> curves, for any integer <m>n</m>.
    There also is a small section on the Borromean Rings.</p>

<section>
<title>Definition of Venn Diagrams</title>

<p>
We follow Gr√ºnbaum <xref ref="ref-Gr75">[Gr75]</xref> in first
  defining a more general concept, that of an independent family.
Let <m>\mathbf{C} = \{ C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n \}</m>
  be a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane.
The collection <m>\mathbf{C}</m> is said to be an <term>independent family</term>
  if the <em>region</em> formed by the intersection of <m>X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n</m>
  is nonempty, where each <m>X_i</m> is either <m>int(C_i)</m>
  (the interior of <m>C_i</m> ) or is <m>ext(C_i)</m>
  (the exterior of <m>C_i</m> ).
</p>

<p>
If, in addition, each such region is connected and there are only
  finitely many points of intersection between curves, then <B>C</B> is a <term>Venn diagram</term>,
  or an <m>n</m>-Venn diagram if we wish to
  emphasize the number of curves in the diagram.
The condition that there are only a finite number of intersection points
is usually assumed in the literature, but often not stated explicitly.
It rules out, e.g., segments of curves from intersecting.
</p>

<p>
Since each region is either inside or outside of a given curve, and there are <m>n</m> curves,
there must be exactly <m>2^n</m> regions in a Venn diagram (including the exterior,
empty region, which is outside of all curves).
Note that some authors refer to diagrams
with <i>fewer</i> than <m>2^n</m> regions as Venn diagrams, but they are more properly termed
<emph>Euler diagrams</emph>, after the mathematician Leonard Euler.  More on these important diagrams can be
found on the page on <a href="VennOtherEJC.html#euler">Generalizations and Extensions</a>.
We refer to a region enclosed by exactly <m>k</m> curves as a <m>k</m>-region or <m>k</m>-set.

  On the left we show the most familiar of all Venn diagrams.
In this case <m>n=3</m>, the simple closed curves are all circles,
  and in the leftmost diagram the 8 regions have been labelled with
  the interiors that are included in each intersection.
The eighth region is the exterior region, corresponding to the empty set.
The colored diagram has all 1-sets colored yellow, all 2-sets red,
  and the 3-set blue.
This diagram also occurs as a minimal projection of the
  Borromean Rings, see <xref ref="sec-Borromean"/>.

  <p>
  On the left we show an example, for <m>n=4</m>,
  of an independent family that is not a Venn diagram.
  Here the simple closed curves are each congruent triangles, which
  are colored red, blue, green, and gold.
  Note that the intersection of the interiors of the red and
  blue triangles with the exteriors of the green and gold
  triangles gives a disconnected region, the two darkly shaded regions
  in the figure.

  The figure below is a Venn diagram of 4 ellipses, originally found by Venn himself
  <xref ref="ref-Ve80">[Ve80]</xref>.  See also a <xref ref="img-ellipses">black-and-white</xref> version
  and its <xref ref="img-Tutte4">Tutte embedding</xref>.

  </p>

<p>
A <term>simple</term> Venn diagram is one in which
no more than two curves intersect at a common point.  Simple diagrams
are in some sense the "nicest" as they are easiest to draw and understand.
All of the figures in this chapter are simple, but we will see many examples
in other chapters of non-simple diagrams.
Unless stated otherwise, we assume that Venn diagrams are simple.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we note that the 3-circle diagram shown above, and the 2-circle diagram for 2 sets, appear often in
the context of proving simple logical arguments.  Readers interested in the applications of Venn
diagrams to logical arguments are referred to the excellent introductory article by Glassner <xref ref="ref-Gl">[Gl]</xref>, 
the book by Shin <xref ref="ref-Sh">[Sh]</xref>, and many standard logic textbooks.

<section xml:id="sec-VennExist">
<title>Constructions of Venn Diagrams</title>
<p>
Above we saw that Venn diagrams exist for <m>n = 3</m>, and it is
  easy to see (for example, by removing circles) that Venn
  diagrams exist for <m>n=0,1,2</m>.
Diagrams exist for all larger values of <m>n</m> as well.
There have been
  several general constructions published (see <xref ref="ref-Be">[Be]</xref>,
  <xref ref="ref-RRS">[RRS]</xref>, <xref ref="ref-Mo">[Mo]</xref>, <xref ref="ref-AC">[AC]</xref>, and
  <xref ref="ref-FGK">[FGK]</xref>, for a sampling in chronological order); we explain two of them
  below.  
They both have the nice property that they produce simple diagrams and have easy to explain inductive constructions.
In both cases, a new curve is added by drawing a new curve <m>C_n</m> that "follows" an existing curve <m>C_i</m>; in one case, 
  <m>i=1</m> and in the other case <m>i=n-1</m>.
</p>

<title>Venn's Construction</title>

<sidebyside>
<p>
Venn's construction, outlined in his original paper
  <xref ref="ref-Ve80">[Ve80]</xref>, is best
  explained by considering the figure to the right.
Start with the 3 circle diagram.
Curves are successively added, with the new curve tracing the
  one last added and dividing each existing region in two.
In the figure they are added in the order blue (4), red (5),
  and green (6).
It should be clear where the seventh curve would be drawn.

<subsection>
<title>Edwards' Construction</title>

<sidebyside>
<image source="gifs/EdwardsCol6.gif"></image>
<p>
  Anthony Edwards <xref ref="ref-Ed89a">[Ed89a]</xref>,
  <xref ref="ref-Ed89b">[Ed89b]</xref> developed another general
  inductive construction that has several nice properties,
  including some symmetry.
It is also best explained by means of an example; refer to
  the diagram on the left.
For <m>n=2</m> the diagram consists of two perpendicular lines.
(Strictly speaking we have to join the endpoints of these lines to make
  them into simple closed curves.)
For <m>n=3</m> a circle is added, centered at the point of intersection of the lines.
Successive curves will all be added that follow this circle,
  weaving back and forth along the circle, again dividing each
  region in two.
For <m>n = 4,5,6</m> the blue, red, and green curves are added,
  in that order.
</p>

<p>
These diagrams have very attractive bipartite colourings as can be
  seen below.
The reason for calling these colourings "bipartite" is explained in 
  <xref ref="ch-VennGraphs">Chapter</xref>, Graphs Associated with Venn
  Diagrams.

<subsection>
<title>Venn Diagrams and Knots</title>

<p>
Every simple Venn diagram can be "woven" in to a
  link<fn>A <term>link</term> is a finite collection of non-intersecting knots 
  (where a <em>knot</em> is a closed, non-self-intersecting curve that is embedded in three dimensions.</fn>;
  as one traverses any curve, the other curves
  alternately go over and under.
The reader will find it an interesting exercise to prove
  that this is always possible for any collection of
  simple closed curves in the plane.
For example, below we show the link that arises (after
  some smooth transformations in 3-space) from Venn's
  general construction for <m>n=4</m>.
This is clearly the same as the link that arises from
  Edwards' general construction for <m>n=4</m>, although
  the constructions give different links for <m>n \ge 5</m>.

<section xml:id="sec-Borromean">
<title>Borromean Rings</title>

<p>
The Borromean rings consists of three interlocking rings, with
  the property that if any one of them is removed, then all
  three separate.
The name Borromean comes from the Borromeo family of Renaissance
  Italy, who used them as their family "crest".
Below we show the Borromean rings.
The shadow, a minimal projection of the rings,
  is the familiar 3-Venn diagram.
By <term>minimal</term> projection of a knot or link onto the plane
  we simply mean a projection that has the least number of
  intersections.
</p>

<image source="gifs/BorRings.gif"></image>

<p>
Below are two other illustrations of the Borromean rings.
The one on the left is not a minimal projection
  (and isn't a Venn diagram).
On the right is a rendering that has a great deal of symmetry as
  an object in three dimensional space.

There is an interesting article on the Borromean rings in the
  The Mathematical Intelligencer, Winter 1995, Vol 17, No. 1.
(Should this go in references?)
</p>

<p>
There is another interesting historical context in which the
  rings arise.
The diagram was found in picture-stones on Gotland, an island
  in the Baltic sea off the southeast coast of Sweden.
These are dated around the ninth century and are thought to
  tell tales from the Norse myths.
To the Norse people of Scandinavia, a drawing of the Borromean
  rings using triangles is known as "Odin's triangle" of the
  "Walknot" (or "valknut" -- the knot of the slain).
The symbol was also carved on the bedposts used in their burials
  at sea.

  about Borromean rings and their generalizations, see the
  web page <xref ref="ref-SJ">[SJ]</xref> of
  Slavick Jablan.
