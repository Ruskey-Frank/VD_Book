<title>Hamburger's non-simple symmetric 11-Venn diagram</title>

<p>
Peter Hamburger <xref ref="ref-Ha02">[Ha02]</xref>
  constructed the first symmetric 11-Venn diagram.
The diagram is monotone and highly non-simple.
It is very similar in form to the diagram for <m>n=7</m> from <xref ref="sec-necklace"/>
  (Symmetric Diagrams, Necklaces, and Chains) 
  but is vastly more complicated because of increase in the the number of regions, 
  intersection points, etc.
In fact, the diagram is so intricate that it is difficult 
  to show in a single figure.
One sector of the diagram is shown in <xref ref="fig-Hamburger11"/>.
Successive sectors may be obtained from this one by
  cyclicly permuting the colors.

<p>
The construction method for this diagram uses a partition of the set of all bitstrings of
length 11.  Recall that the Venn dual can be labelled with bitstrings corresponding
to regions, as we discussed <xref ref="ch-VennGraphs"/>, Graphs Associated
with Venn Diagrams.
The construction then uses chains of bitstrings connected together to build the large dual
graph of the sector, which then is repeated to give the entire diagram.
</p>

<p>
Since the diagram is highly non-simple and not rigid, the diagram can be turned in to many
others by separating any or all separable vertices.  Hamburger has published variants of
the diagram with vertex sets from 462 up to 1001 by increments of 11 in <xref ref="ref-Ha02b">[Ha02b]</xref>.
He and other co-authors have used similar techniques to create other diagrams; see the sub-sections below.
</p>

<p>
For <m>n = 11</m>, the minimum possible number of vertices is <m>\lceil (2^{11} - 2) / 10 \rceil = 205</m>.  
This is not divisible by 11, so the smallest number of vertices possible in a symmetric 11-Venn diagram is at least <m>209 = 11 \cdot 19</m>.  
In <xref ref="ref-HS03">[HS03]</xref> Hamburger and Sali extended the above method to 
  produce a diagram with <m>231 = 11 \cdot 21</m> vertices, quite close to the minimum possible, and then later found a diagram with
  <m>220 = 11 \cdot 20</m> vertices (as yet unpublished - thanks to Peter Hamburger for showing us the diagram).  
Of course, the resulting diagrams are highly non-monotone, since a monotone 11-Venn diagram has at least
   <m>{11 \choose 5} = 462 = 11 \cdot 42</m> vertices by <xref ref="thm-MinVertMonotone"/>.
</p>

<p>
Many of the symmetric 11-Venn diagrams mentioned here, in papers by Peter Hamburger and his
co-authors, have been turned into works of art by the artist Edit Hepp, Hamburger's spouse.  
Readers are encouraged to seek out the papers in print to view the diagrams.  The processes used to create 
the artwork are explained in <xref ref="ref-HH">[HH]</xref>.

<subsubsection>
<title>Mamakani's simple symmetric 11-Venn diagram</title>

<p>
Although Hamburger found a non-simple symmetric 11-Venn diagram, there seemed little hope of extending
  his ad-hoc methodology or diagrams to get a <em>simple</em> symmetric 11-Venn diagram; some significant new insights were needed.
Some people had attempted algorithmic solutions, but had met with failure because the potential solution space is
  so huge.
In this sub-subsection we will give an outline of an approach that succeeded along with some relevant figures, some of
  which are rather attractive.
</p>

<p>
One strategy is to reduce the size of the potential solution space by imposing additional constraints on the diagrams, but one has
  to be careful; too much constraint and there may be no such diagram, too little and the solution space can still be to large.
Mamakani's approach was to look for additional properties in subsets of the set of symmetric 7-Venn diagrams.
To that end, we define a <q>crosscut</q> in a Venn diagram.
</p> 

<definition xml:id="def-crosscut">
<idx>Crosscut</idx>
<statement>
<p>
A <emph>crosscut</emph> in a simple monotone <m>n</m>-Venn diagram is a segment of a curve that extends from the innermost face
  to the (unbounded) outermost face, and intersects each of the other <m>n-1</m> curves exactly once.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
Imagine a curve <m>C</m> in a Venn diagram.  By <xref ref="thm-NoTwoEdges"/> the <m>C</m> can touch the outer face at most once, and the
  inner face at most once.
Hence, it is impossible for <m>C</m> to have 3 or more crosscuts in a Venn diagram.
For a curve in a <m>n</m>-Venn diagram to have 2 crosscuts, that curve must have exactly <m>2(n-1)</m> intersections with other
  curves in the diagram; that is, such a curve must intersect all <m>n-1</m> curves as it extends from the unbounded exterior
  to the interior of all the curves, and then hit all <m>n-1</m> curves again as it returns to the unbounded exterior; let us
  call such a curve a <term>mint</term> curve, since it has the <em>m</em>inimum number of <em>int</em>ersections possible in a Venn diagram.<idx><h>curve</h><h>mint</h></idx>
</p>
<p>  
For each <m>n</m> there is an <m>n</m>-Venn diagram in which two distinct curves have two crosscuts; that is, the Venn diagram contains
  two mint curves.
For example consider the cylindrical projection of Edwards 8-Venn diagram shown in <xref ref="fig-Edwards_Cylinder"/>.
Observe that the red and black curves are mint curves; each part of the curve drawn as a straight line intersects 6 curves, and the 7th intersection is a red-black intersection.
For <m>n > 5</m> it is not known whether there exists an <m>n</m>-Venn diagram with 3 or more mint curves.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
If <m>n \gt 3</m>, then a simple symmetric <m>n</m>-Venn diagram has a most one crosscut per curve.
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
We argued above that a curve in a Venn diagram can not have three or more crosscuts.
Suppose that there is a mint curve in a symmetric <m>n</m>-Venn diagram.
Since the diagram is symmetric, every curve must be a mint curve, and thus the total number
  of intersections (vertices) in the diagram is <m>n(n-1)</m>.  
On the other hand, a simple <m>n</m>-Venn diagram has exactly <m>2^n-2</m> vertices.  
The equation <m>n(n-1) = 2^n-2</m> has a solution for <m>n = 1,2,3</m>, but not for any <m>n > 3</m>.
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
The <m>7</m>-Venn diagrams with a crosscut are Hamilton (P2), Manawatu (P6), Victoria (P4), M4, M5, M11, M12, and M15.
This is easily verified examining the drawings in <xref ref="fig-polar7"/> and <xref ref="fig-all17"/>, or by looking
for subsequences in the Grunbaum encodings of the form <m>1 \ c_2 c_3 c_4 c_5 c_6</m>, where <m>c_2 c_3 c_4 c_5 c_6</m> is
a permutation of <m>2,3,4,5,6</m>.  For example, in <xref ref="fig-all17">M11</xref>, and referring to 
<xref ref="tbl-all17"/>, the subsequence is <m>142356</m>.

</figure>

<p>
However, restricting the search to only diagrams with a crosscut still took too long, and so the search was further 
  refined by looking for some symmetric substructures within the diagrams possessing a crosscut. 
Consider <xref ref="fig-VD7cluster"/>.  The colored part of the diagram is called a <term>cluster</term>; it is an
  edge-connected collection of regions, that, when rotated <m>n</m> times, uniquely accounts for each face of the Venn diagram,
  except for the innermost and outermost faces.
The particular cluster shown has a symmetric substructure when reflected about the crosscut, as shown in 
  <xref ref="fig-VD7clusterCyl"/>.

</figure>

<p>
We can formalize the symmetry that we observe in <xref ref="fig-VD7clusterCyl"/> by considering lists of curve intersections.
Assume that the curves have been labelled <m>1,2,\ldots,n,</m> in clockwise order where the crosscut is <m>C_1</m>.

<theorem>

<statement>
<p>
There is no monotone simple symmetric <m>n</m>-Venn diagram with crosscut and polar symmetry for <m>n \gt 7</m>.

<title>Symmetric diagrams with <m>n = 13</m> curves</title>
</subsection>

<p>
When the same approach used in the previous section is applied to try and find a symmetric 13-Venn diagram, the seach space seemed to be too large 
  and no solution was produced.
However, by refining the idea of a crosscut, many solutions were eventually found.
Let us re-examine a diagram the has crosscut symmetry,
