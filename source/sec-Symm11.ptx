<title>Hamburger's non-simple symmetric 11-Venn diagram</title>

<p>
Peter Hamburger <xref ref="ref-Ha02">[Ha02]</xref>
  constructed the first symmetric 11-Venn diagram.
The diagram is monotone and highly non-simple.
It is very similar in form to the diagram for <m>n=7</m> from <xref ref="sec-necklace"/>
  (Symmetric Diagrams, Necklaces, and Chains) 
  but is vastly more complicated because of increase in the the number of regions, 
  intersection points, etc.
In fact, the diagram is so intricate that it is difficult 
  to show in a single figure.
One sector of the diagram is shown in <xref ref="fig-Hamburger11"/>.
Successive sectors may be obtained from this one by
  cyclicly permuting the colors.

<p>
The construction method for this diagram uses a partition of the set of all bitstrings of
length 11.  Recall that the Venn dual can be labelled with bitstrings corresponding
to regions, as we discussed on the page <a href="VennGraphEJC.html#dual">Graphs Associated
with Venn Diagrams</a>.
The construction then uses chains of bitstrings connected together to build the large dual
graph of the sector, which then is repeated to give the entire diagram.
</p>

<p>
Since the diagram is highly non-simple and not rigid, the diagram can be turned in to many
others by separating any or all separable vertices.  Hamburger has published variants of
the diagram with vertex sets from 462 up to 1001 by increments of 11 in <xref ref="ref-Ha02b">[Ha02b]</xref>.
He and other co-authors have used similar techniques to create other diagrams; see the sub-sections below.
