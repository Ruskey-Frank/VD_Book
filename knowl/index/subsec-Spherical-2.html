<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> There is a much richer set of symmetries of the sphere than there on the plane, and it is natural to investigate whether these additional symmetries can be possessed by Venn diagrams. Let’s consider a few examples of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-Venn diagrams for small <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> The case of <span class="process-math">\(n=1\)</span> is rather uninteresting since a circle in the plane has infintely many symmetries, both reflections and rotations. For <span class="process-math">\(n=2\)</span> things are rather more interesting. In the plane, the standard two circle diagram has 4 symmetries,  based on reflections about a line through the centers of the circles, and about a line through the 2 points of intersection. See <a href="sec-SymmVariant.html#fig-2vennSphere" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-2vennSphere.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 4.6.8">Figure 4.6.8</a>. It is interesting that reflection about the horizontal axis leaves the colors of the circles fixed, whereas the vertical reflection necessitates a color swap. Here the group of symmetries is Known as the Klein <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-group. However, on the sphere, the diagram can be drawn as 2 great circles, which intersect perpendicularly at two antipodal points (the poles), as in <a href="sec-SymmVariant.html#fig-2vennSphere" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-2vennSphere.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 4.6.8">Figure 4.6.8</a>.</div>
