<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> On the sphere there a clearly many more symmetries for the 2-Venn diagram, but how many exactly? Symmetries are obtained by rotating and reflecting. Rotations occur in increments of <span class="process-math">\(\pi/4\)</span> radians about the polar axis, and by rotating <span class="process-math">\(\pi/2\)</span> about axes that intersect the equator at antipodal points; these points are located where the equator intersects a curve (two axes) and at the half-way points between two points of intersection with the equator (another two axes). Reflections can be about a plane through the equator, and planes through the poles and one of the eight points along the equator mentioned before. The effect of these rotations/reflections and their compositions is that the light blue region, which makes up 1/16 of the sphere (a seqment of the curve is included with this region) can be mapped to any of the 16 such regions, which makes up the entire sphere. The light blue region of the sphere is known as a <dfn class="terminology">fundamental region</dfn>. Thus we get a much richer set of symmetries for the 2-Venn diagram on the sphere, 4 on the plane versus 16 of them on the sphere.</div>
