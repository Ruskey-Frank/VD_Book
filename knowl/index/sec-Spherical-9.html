<div class="para"> The systematic mathematical study of symmetries of Venn diagrams on the sphere was initiated in Mark Westonâ€™s PhD thesis, [We09]. Some results of the thesis are reported in [RW11]. An <dfn class="terminology">involution</dfn> is a self-inverse mapping. Amongst isometric mappings of the sphere onto itself, the involutory mappings fall into three categories: reflections about a plane through a great circle, reflections about a line through the center of the sphere, and reflections through the center of the sphere. We will refer to the symmetry of reflections through the center of the sphere as <dfn class="terminology">antipodal symmetry</dfn>, since antipodal points are mapped to each other.</div>
