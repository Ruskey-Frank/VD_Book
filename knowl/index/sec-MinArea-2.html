<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> On his "Math Recreations" website (now defunct), Mark Thompson proposed the novel problem of finding <dfn class="terminology">Venn polyominoes</dfn>; these are Venn diagrams where each curve is the outline of a polyomino.  A polyomino is a generalization of a domino whereby the shape is formed by gluing together unit squares along their edges with no holes allowed. When considering Venn polyominoes we need to relax the restriction that curves intersect only finitely. Chow and Ruskey, in <a href="ch-VennRefs-3.html#ref-CR05" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/ref-CR05.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Paragraph">[CR05]Â </a>, used Venn polyominoes to consider the special case of area-proportional diagrams when all regions have the same area, which can be viewed as being of unit area. For this reason, such Venn polyominoes are called <dfn class="terminology">minimum area Venn diagrams</dfn> A convenient way to build such diagrams is on the grid; each polyomino is axis-aligned and each region is a connected area of unit squares. Thompson has found several examples of <em class="emphasis">congruent</em> Venn polyominoes for <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> up to 4 sets, and Chow and Ruskey found an example for 5 sets; we show some of these below.  Congruent minimum area Venn diagrams are not know for any <span class="process-math">\(n &gt; 5\text{.}\)</span>
