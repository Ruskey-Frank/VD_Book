<div class="para"> On his "Math Recreations" website (now defunct), Mark Thompson proposed the novel problem of finding <em class="emphasis">Venn polyominoes</em>; these are Venn diagrams where each curve is the perimeter of an axis-aligned polyomino in an integer grid. A polyomino is a generalization of a domino whereby the shape is formed by gluing together unit squares along their edges with no holes allowed. When considering Venn polyominoes we need to relax the Venn diagram restriction that curves intersect only finitely. Chow and Ruskey, in <a href="ch-VennRefs-3.html#ref-CR05" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/ref-CR05.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Paragraph">[CR05] </a>, used Venn polyominoes to consider the special case of area-proportional diagrams when all regions have the same area, which can be viewed as being a one unit area. For this reason, such Venn polyominoes can be called <dfn class="terminology">minimum area Venn diagrams</dfn>. We will prefer to call them <dfn class="terminology">polyVenn diagrams</dfn>. Thompson found several examples of <em class="emphasis">congruent</em> polyVenn diagrams for <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> up to 4 curves, and Chow and Ruskey found an example for 5 curves; we show some of these in <a href="sec-MinArea.html#fig-polyVenn-congruent" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-polyVenn-congruent.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 5.5.1">Figure 5.5.1</a> below. Note that only translations of curves are used in (a),(b),(c), but that reflection is used in (d). Congruent polyVenn diagrams are not know for any <span class="process-math">\(n \gt 5\text{.}\)</span>
