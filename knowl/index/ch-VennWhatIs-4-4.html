<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> Since each region is either inside or outside of a given curve, and there are <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> curves, there must be exactly <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> regions in a Venn diagram (including the exterior, empty region, which is outside of all curves). Note that some authors refer to diagrams with fewer than <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> regions as Venn diagrams, but they are more properly termed Euler diagrams, after the mathematician Leonard Euler.  More on these important diagrams can be found on the page on Generalizations and Extensions. We refer to a region enclosed by exactly <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> curves as a <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>-region or <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>-set.</div>
