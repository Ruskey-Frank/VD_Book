<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> Since symmetric <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-Venn diagrams only exist for prime <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> it is natural to wonder what happens if we relax the definition to get other Venn diagrams with some other aspect of symmetry. Consider the various 3-Venn diagrams shown in <a href="ch-VennGraphs-9.html#subsec-3VennClasses" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.7.1: The six Venn classes">Subsection 3.7.1</a>. Diagrams #3.3, #3.4, #3.5, and #3.6 of <a href="ch-VennGraphs-9.html#img-Class2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/img-Class2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 3.7.3">Class 2 3.7.3</a> and <a href="ch-VennGraphs-9.html#img-Class3" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/img-Class3.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 3.7.5">Class 3 3.7.5</a> each have a reflective symmetry about a horizontal or vertical line. On first glance, diagrams #3.1 and #3.2 (<a href="ch-VennGraphs-9.html#img-Class1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/img-Class1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 3.7.1">Class 1 3.7.1</a>) also appear to have at least one reflective symmetry, but they don’t. However, #3.1 and #3.2 do have a reflective symmetry <em class="emphasis">if the color of the curves is ignored</em>. Let us say that a Venn diagram is <dfn class="terminology">monochrome</dfn> if the curves colors are ignored. If a Venn diagram is simple, then there is no loss of information since the curves can be uniquely recovered from the monotone version, but this is not true for non-simple diagrams. E.g., as monochrome Venn diagrams, #3.4 and #3.5 are indistinguishable, as are #3.3 and #3.6. Also worth noting is that if regions are colored by cardinality, then #3.3 and #3.6 remain indistinguishable, unlike #3.4 and #3.5. The above observations suggest that it might be interesting to look at Venn diagrams whose monochrome versions are symmetric, which is what we do below.</div>
