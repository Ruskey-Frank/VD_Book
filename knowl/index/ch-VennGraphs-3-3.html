<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para"> With each Venn diagram, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{C}\text{,}\)</span> we may associate another plane graph called the <dfn class="terminology">Venn dual</dfn>, which is denoted <span class="process-math">\(D(\mathbf{C})\text{,}\)</span> the planar dual of the Venn diagram. (Warning: Some authors use the term "Venn graph" to refer to the dual.) Its vertices are the connected open regions (faces) of <span class="process-math">\(V(\mathbf{C})\text{.}\)</span> Two vertices are connected by an edge if they share a common boundary. By default the edges are colored (by the color of the corresponding edge in the Venn diagram). At times it is also useful to label the vertices with a length-<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> bitstring consisting of 0s and 1s; if the curves are labelled 1 to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> then we set bit <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> to 1 if the vertex is enclosed by curve <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> 0 otherwise.    Labels of adjacent vertices differ in exactly one bit position as one curve in the Venn diagram is crossed by one edge in the Venn dual. For example, the Venn dual of the three circle Venn diagram is a planar embedding of the 3-cube, <span class="process-math">\(Q_3\text{.}\)</span> Clearly, every <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-Venn dual is a planar spanning subgraph of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-cube, <span class="process-math">\(Q_n\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{C}\)</span> is a simple Venn diagram, then every face of <span class="process-math">\(D(\mathbf{C})\)</span> is a quadrilateral, and thus <span class="process-math">\(D(\mathbf{C})\)</span> is a maximal bipartite<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="ch-VennGraphs-3-3-17"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 3.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="ch-VennGraphs-3-3-17">A <dfn class="terminology">bipartite</dfn> graph is one in which the vertices can be partitioned into two sets <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> where every edge is incident with a vertex from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and a vertex from <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-cube is bipartite, and thus so is the Venn dual.</div></details> planar graph.</div>
