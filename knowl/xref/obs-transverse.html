</h3>In a simple Venn diagram, at every point of intersection, the two curves meet transversally. I.e., the two curves cross and do not meerly "kiss" each other. More generally, at any point of intersection in a Venn diagram, there must be at least two curves that meet transversally.<details xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="hiddenproof born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h4></summary><article class="hiddenproof knowl__content"><div class="para">Suppose that curve <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> kisses curve <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> at point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in Venn diagram <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> In a rotation about <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> there are 4 regions, which we may denote <span class="process-math">\(AA\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(AB\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(BB\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(BA\text{.}\)</span> Unless <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(BA\)</span> are connected we can not have a Venn diagram since these regions are in the same set of interiors and exteriors of curves.  We will show that they are not connected, a contradiction which will prove the observation. Because <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a Venn diagram, curves <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> must have at least two transverse intersections, for otherwise one curve would be contained in the other.   Define a closed curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> by following curve <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with region <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> on its boundary until first encountering a transverse intersection <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and then follow <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> back to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  The curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> might have points of kissing, but no transverse intersections.  To finish the proof, observe that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> contains region <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> but excludes region <span class="process-math">\(BA\text{,}\)</span> and thus they are not connected.  The more general statement may be proven by essentially the same proof.</div></article></details></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-defs.html#obs-transverse">in-context</a></span>
